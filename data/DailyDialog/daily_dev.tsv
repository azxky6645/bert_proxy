56	I'm sorry , sir . Let me transfer you to my supervisor .	neutral	3

73	This particular refrigerator is a very good choice .	neutral	1
74	Tell me about it .	neutral	3
75	Not only is it affordable , but it comes with all the appliances .	neutral	1
76	What are the appliances .	neutral	2
77	It has an ice maker , water dispenser , and plenty of room on the inside .	neutral	1
78	I'd like to see it for myself .	neutral	3
79	Go right ahead .	neutral	3
80	I like what I see .	neutral	1
81	Oh , well . It was fun to be the winner . But ... it's too big . I must be an extra small in the States .	neutral	1
82	So what about the tennis racket ?	neutral	3
83	Look ! It's amazing . I can't wait to try it out !	happiness	4
84	How much did that end up costing you ?	neutral	2

102	Yes , that's right . We want as much info as possible before we agree to anything .	neutral	3

104	So , do you think our corporation will be eligible for this ?	neutral	2
105	Yes , and it's extremely simple . All you need to do is make a Network Settlement Agreement with us .	neutral	3

120	I am just waiting for my friends . It won't be long .	neutral	4
121	Sir , the curb here is not for parking .	neutral	3
122	But I didn't see the sign , Ma ’ am .	neutral	4
123	There is a sign at the corner of the street . When you turned in here , you should have seen it .	neutral	3
124	I didn't see it .	neutral	4
125	I am sorry , sir . I have to give you a ticket . You can appeal to the court within 14 days . You will avoid paying the fine if you can prove that you are not at fault .	sadness	3
126	Are you a goal-oriented person ?	neutral	2
127	Yes , I am . I always make a plan before I do anything .	neutral	1
128	Where do you want to be in 5 years ?	neutral	2
129	I don't want to have a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing .	neutral	1
130	That sounds very reasonable .	neutral	1
131	It's the most important thing to me .	neutral	1
132	If you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ?	neutral	2

136	What is your long-range objective ?	neutral	2
137	I haven't thought it over at all .	neutral	1
138	What do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ?	neutral	2
139	I think the most important thing is the interest in the job .	neutral	1
140	I'd like to open a current account .	neutral	3
141	Certainly . May I see your social security and your ID , please .	neutral	3
142	Here you are . I wonder how much interest can I earn from a current account .	neutral	2
143	Oh , current accounts don't pay out interest .	neutral	1
144	Why is that ?	neutral	2
145	It's primarily designed for business transactions . That is , writing checks to pay for bills , buying things and sending money . We won't expect a large amount of deposit in a current account .	neutral	1
146	I see . How do I draw money for my own use then ?	neutral	2
147	Good morning , Helen .	neutral	1
148	Good morning , Steven .	neutral	1
149	So , what's the status of our advertising campaign ?	neutral	2
150	It'll be a national campaign starting next week .	neutral	1
151	What style will the ads be ?	neutral	2
152	I suggest that we focus on slice of life , showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool ice-cream sandwich .	neutral	3
153	Sounds like a good idea . Will we have a new slogan ?	neutral	2
154	Definitely .	neutral	1
155	I'd like to taste some local dishes . What would you recommend ?	neutral	2
156	That's fine . You must try this dish .	neutral	3
157	Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ?	neutral	2
158	It's fish steamed and served with our special sauce .	neutral	1
159	Is it good ?	neutral	2
160	Sure . It's a most popular dish .	neutral	1
161	I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together .	neutral	4
162	We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ?	neutral	2
163	What kind do you have ?	neutral	2
164	We have French and Thousand Island .	neutral	1
165	Make it Thousand Island .	neutral	1
166	Taxi !	neutral	3
167	Where will you go , sir ?	neutral	2
168	Friendship Hotel .	neutral	1
169	OK , it's not far from here .	neutral	1
170	I have something important to do , can you fast the speed ?	neutral	3
171	Sure , I'll try my best . Here we are .	neutral	4
172	How much should I pay you ?	neutral	2
173	The reading on the meter is 15 yuan .	neutral	1
174	Here's 20 yuan , keep the change .	neutral	3
175	Thank you very much .	happiness	4
176	Mr . Johnson ’ s office . Cindy speaking .	neutral	1
177	Hi , Cindy . It ’ s Michael Kurt . Is Mr . Johnson in ?	neutral	2
178	No , I ’ m sorry , Mr . Kurt . He ’ s stepped out for a bit . Would you like me to have him call you ?	neutral	3
179	Yeah , that ’ ll be great . I ’ m on extension 4283 .	neutral	4
180	Hi , Mark .	neutral	1
181	Hi , Bill . I ’ d like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday .	neutral	3
182	All right .	neutral	4
183	So , what do we do now ?	neutral	2
184	This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords .	neutral	3
185	Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ’ ll deposit one month ’ s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ’ s rent in advance . I understand that I ’ ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs .	neutral	4
186	Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out .	neutral	1
187	Can I pay you by check ?	neutral	3
188	Sure . A check will be fine .	neutral	4
189	Is there a laundry room in the basement ?	neutral	2
190	Yes .	neutral	1
191	Can I sign the lease right now ?	neutral	3
192	Good morning ! What can I do for you ?	neutral	2
193	I'm thinking of travelling to Suzhou in July . Could you recommend some tourist programs for that ?	neutral	3
194	With pleasure . We arrange two kinds of tourist programs for Suzhou , a six-day tour by train and a five-day flying journey .	neutral	4
195	How much does a six-day tour by train cost ?	neutral	2
196	Five hundred yuan .	neutral	1
197	Does that include hotels and meals ?	neutral	2
198	Oh , yes , and admission tickets for places of interest as well .	neutral	1
199	That sounds reasonable . What about the five-day flying journey ? How much is that ?	neutral	2
200	Eight hundred and fifty yuan .	neutral	1
201	Covering all expenses ?	neutral	2
202	Yes . But there is no half fare for children . They must pay full fare .	neutral	1
203	I can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! Are you trying to lose your job ?	surprise	2
204	Of course not . I'm just observing casual day . On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire .	neutral	1
205	Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ?	surprise	2
206	We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes .	neutral	1
207	I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ?	neutral	2
208	Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want .	neutral	1
209	It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity .	neutral	1
210	Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days .	neutral	1

226	Why didn't you go to school yesterday ?	neutral	2
227	I stayed home because I wasn't feeling well .	neutral	1
228	What was your problem ?	neutral	2
229	My stomach was bothering me .	neutral	1
230	Are you feeling any better ?	neutral	2
231	I'm still feeling a little sick .	neutral	1
232	I'm going to the store , would you like any Pesto Pistol ?	neutral	3
233	I'd appreciate that .	neutral	4
234	Excuse me , but please empty your pockets of all the metal things and put them in this tray .	neutral	3
235	Including my keys ?	neutral	2
236	Yes , and please step over there .	neutral	3
237	All right . What shall I do now ?	neutral	4
238	Just open your bags so we can check them . After that you can pick them up right behind that X-ray machine .	neutral	3
239	I've got film in my bag .	neutral	1
240	That's all right . This machine will not damage the film .	neutral	1
241	That's fine .	neutral	1
242	Can I have your boarding pass ? We need to stamp it .	neutral	3
243	Sure . Here you are .	neutral	4
244	Thank you .	neutral	1
245	Am I through now ?	neutral	3
246	Yes . Here is your boarding pass .	neutral	4
247	Thank you and goodbye .	neutral	1
248	Welcome to Flash Foot , sir.How can I help you ?	neutral	2
249	I ’ d like extra prints made of these photos .	neutral	1
250	Do you have your negatives ?	neutral	2
251	Yes.Here they are . I ’ Ve marked how many prints I want on each shot .	neutral	1

256	I'm interested in taking a tour to Sydney .	neutral	1
257	Well , we have a package tour there .	neutral	1
258	How much does it cost ?	neutral	2
259	$ 600 .	neutral	1
260	Does that include the insurance ?	neutral	2
261	Of course .	neutral	1
262	Hello , Mr . Wang . I am glad to meet you here at the fair .	neutral	1
263	Like wise . Take a seat , please . How about a cup of tea ?	neutral	3
264	Sure . Thank you . It seems your business is prosperous . There are many customers here .	neutral	4
265	Yes , it's not too bad . Our sales are going up year after year . And we still have a large potential production capacity .	neutral	1
266	Well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ?	neutral	2
267	That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad .	neutral	1
268	We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools . What do you think ?	neutral	3
269	That sounds good .	neutral	4
270	Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ?	neutral	2
271	Usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents .	neutral	1
272	4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough .	neutral	3
273	Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase .	neutral	3
274	You mean to saya	neutral	1
275	It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ?	neutral	2
276	We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment .	neutral	1
277	All right . If it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately .	neutral	3
278	Think it over . We hope to keep a good business relationship with you .	neutral	4
279	Thank you for your help .	neutral	1
280	I'm glad these batteries are on sale .	happiness	1
281	I'm sorry . These batteries are not on sale .	sadness	1
282	But that's what the ad said .	neutral	1
283	I'm sorry . If you look at the ad again , you'll see that the other brand is on sale .	neutral	1
284	Oh . You're right . I misread the ad .	neutral	1
285	Yes , many people make that mistake .	neutral	1
286	Well , you can't blame them . It's a confusing ad .	neutral	1
287	You're right . Many ads are like that .	neutral	1
288	Well , as long as I'm here .	neutral	1
289	Just one second , and I'll give you the batteries that are on sale .	neutral	3

291	I don't have a girlfriend . I'm single .	neutral	4
292	Oh , that's right . Well , there are going to be many beautiful girls at the party tonight , anyway .	neutral	3
293	No , I like being single . I never thought lonely , I'm focus on my career . Maybe I'll start to look for my girl when I achieve success .	neutral	4
294	Why is that ?	neutral	2
295	Because I'm living a real world , a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money . Franklin speaking the girls I've met wounldn't married a man wounldn't make enough money .	neutral	1
296	I agree , a man needs good career.But that doesn't mean he should have a little fun , too .	neutral	3

300	Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . .	sadness	1
301	I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time !	anger	3
302	I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures .	neutral	1
303	I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP !	anger	1
304	Yes , sir ?	neutral	2
305	Can I have Mr . J . Smith paged ? He said he'd be in the main dining room . I'm Mr . J . B . White .	neutral	3

312	That ’ s what I am here for . What questions can I answer for you ?	neutral	2
313	I have poison oak , and I need help with the rash that won ’ t stop itching .	neutral	3
314	The best product is Techne , and you can buy either the lotion or cream .	neutral	3
315	Which one is best ?	neutral	2
316	The cream form is very popular .	neutral	1
317	Can I do anything else to help with the itching ?	neutral	2
318	You could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker .	neutral	3
319	I appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching .	neutral	1
320	Anytime you have a question , please feel free to ask .	neutral	3
321	Excuse me . Something is wrong with my bank card . Can you help me ?	neutral	3
322	Yes . What's the problem ?	neutral	2
323	Just a mistake with my name . It should be issued as Steven , but the card is under the name ' Steven ' .	neutral	1
324	Oh , I am very sorry about that . It's our fault . I will arrange someone to correct it immediately .	neutral	4
325	OK , no problem . To err is human .	neutral	1
326	Anyway , we apologize for the inconvenience we have brought you . Please just wait for a moment , and it will be fixed .	neutral	3
327	Thank you very much .	happiness	1

330	I got Jacob . Any ideas what to get him ?	neutral	2
331	Booze !	neutral	1
332	Yeah , you ’ re right . Can ’ t go wrong with that .	neutral	1
333	Is everything to your satisfaction ?	neutral	2
334	No , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh .	neutral	3
335	Oh , sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual . I will look into the matter .	neutral	4
336	This is very annoying .	neutral	1
337	I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course .	neutral	2
338	No , I don't risk it .	neutral	1
339	How about a delicious dessert then , with our compliment ?	neutral	3
340	I'm not keen on dessert as a habit . They are fattening .	neutral	4
341	I see , sir . I'm sure everything will be right next time you come .	neutral	1
342	Excuse me , are you Jane ?	neutral	2
343	No , I'm Mary .	neutral	1
344	Oh , are you in Class Four ?	neutral	2
345	No , I'm in Class There .	neutral	1
346	Excuse me , but I'm not feeling too well . I think I'm going to throw up .	neutral	1
347	There's an airsickness bag behind the seat that's in front of you .	neutral	1
348	I must've missed it .	neutral	1
349	Is this your first time flying ?	neutral	2
350	Yes . I'm going to San Francisco .	neutral	1
351	Oh , it's a beautiful city . I think you'll like it .	neutral	1
352	Hey , I'm feeling much better already .	neutral	1
353	Sometimes if you don't think about it , that sick feeling will go away on its own .	neutral	3
354	Thanks . By the way , my name is Mary .	neutral	4
355	I'm Frank . Nice to meet you .	neutral	1
356	Welcome to Al's Bakery . What can I get you ?	neutral	2

360	We are out at the moment . May I suggest some rye bread ?	neutral	3
361	Sure that sounds good . Do you have any cakes ?	happiness	2
362	We have various birthday cakes and also ice cream cakes .	neutral	1
363	I'll just take a cheesecake .	neutral	3
364	Will that be all ?	neutral	2
365	Yes .	neutral	1
366	Your total is forty three dollars and twenty cents .	neutral	4
367	Good morning , ladies and gentlemen , we are happy you have all come out for our training workshop . Today we have a great line-up of speakers to talk to you . First on our program is a well-renown expert in the field of international economic development , Harvard's own Dr . James Smith . Dr . Smith has been involved in economic research for over twenty years , and has taught at Harvard since 1995 . And now , without further adieu , we'd like to welcome Mr . James Smith .	neutral	3
368	Thank you , Mr . Jackson , ladies and gentlemen , colleagues , friends . The subject of my talk is international relations in a morgen world . I plan to say a few words about the current situation in the Middle East and how it affects world economy . I'd like to give you an overview of the way that the economies of seemingly unrelated countries are intertwined . I've divided my talk into three parts , first an overview of international relations , second a discussion of current political situations , and lastly trends for the future . My presentation will take about two hours , but there will be a twenty-minute break in the middle . We'll stop for lunch at 12 .	neutral	1
369	You're looking rather pale , why ?	neutral	2
370	I couldn't sleep well recently .	neutral	1
371	You'd get plenty of sleep for you work so hard .	neutral	3
372	I always drink too much wine in the evening .	neutral	1
373	You shan't drink more wine in the evening .	neutral	3
374	Yes , you are right .	neutral	4
375	And you'd take some exercise every day .	neutral	3
376	Many thanks for your advice .	neutral	4
377	Hello Mrs Parker , how have you been ?	neutral	2
378	Hello Dr Peters . Just fine thank you . Ricky and I are here for his vaccines .	happiness	1
379	Very well . Let's see , according to his vaccination record , Ricky has received his Polio , Tetanus and Hepatitis B shots . He is 14 months old , so he is due for Hepatitis A , Chickenpox and Measles shots .	neutral	1
380	What about Rubella and Mumps ?	neutral	2
381	Well , I can only give him these for now , and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest .	neutral	1
382	OK , great . Doctor , I think I also may need a Tetanus booster . Last time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago !	happiness	1
383	We will check our records and I'll have the nurse administer and the booster as well . Now , please hold Ricky's arm tight , this may sting a little .	neutral	3
384	I ’ m interested in teaching at your school .	neutral	3
385	Great . Are you a qualified teacher ?	neutral	2
386	Yes .	neutral	1
387	What kind of teaching certificate do you have ?	neutral	2
388	I have a TEFL certificate .	neutral	1
389	How many years of experience do you have ?	neutral	2
390	I have three years of teaching ESL and four years of teaching per-school children .	neutral	1
391	When did you get your TEFL certificate ?	neutral	2
392	I got my TEFL certificate three years ago .	neutral	1
393	Why do you want to teach at our school ?	neutral	2
394	Well , I ’ Ve heard many good things about it . I also like teaching young children .	neutral	1
395	That ’ s great . Can you speak Chinese ?	neutral	2
396	Yes , just a little .	neutral	1
397	Can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10:00 ?	neutral	3
398	I sure can .	neutral	4
399	Great . See you then .	neutral	1
400	Why is the car before us stopping ?	neutral	2
401	What's going on ?	neutral	2
402	Look . Two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . That's why that car stops .	neutral	1
403	More and more people easily get irritated while driving .	neutral	1
404	Yes . This is what is called road rage .	neutral	1
405	This is today ’ s schedule . At 8 thirty AM , conference with the department managers . At 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the staff for preventatives .	neutral	3
406	That ’ s great . What are the prizes ?	neutral	2
407	3000 RIB as bonus for each person .	neutral	1
408	To encourage the staff increases .	neutral	1
409	Ok . Next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 AM . At 12 AM , back here for lunch .	neutral	3
410	What about the afternoon ?	neutral	2
411	At 2 PM , give a presentation here with the press . At four o ’ clock sharp , have dinner with Mr . Smith , manager of NCC .	neutral	3
412	This is Lincoln Bank , Consumer Credit Department . How can I help you ?	neutral	2
413	Ah , hello . I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan .	neutral	3
414	We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ?	neutral	2
415	Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account .	neutral	1
416	The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ...	neutral	1
417	Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want .	neutral	1
418	That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ?	neutral	2
419	Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB .	neutral	1
420	What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment .	neutral	3
421	Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting !	happiness	4
422	Hi , my name is Tom .	neutral	1
423	Tom , the new sales representative ? Nice to meet you ! I'm Melinda .	neutral	1
424	Nice to meet you too.Melinda .	neutral	1
425	Now let me show you around . This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over here is the sales department .	neutral	1
426	Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small .	surprise	1
427	Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there .	neutral	3
428	It looks like you guys work hard .	neutral	1
429	I tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.Just kidding . Oh , your cubicle is over the . And this way . Those are all private offices the managers offices .	neutral	1
430	Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs .	neutral	3
431	Sure thing .	neutral	4
432	What do you think of our price ?	neutral	2
433	Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ?	neutral	1
434	Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly .	neutral	1
435	I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable .	neutral	1
436	I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .	neutral	1
437	I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .	neutral	3
438	I ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .	neutral	4
439	Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ?	neutral	3
440	We've already cut down our price to cost level .	neutral	4
441	Is that all ?	neutral	3
442	Yes , this is the best we can do .	neutral	4
443	I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered .	neutral	4
444	So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ?	neutral	2
445	It ’ s great , dad . I don ’ t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money .	happiness	1
446	Even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money .	neutral	1
447	I ’ Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ?	neutral	2
448	You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest .	neutral	1
449	But what if I need my money suddenly ?	neutral	2
450	The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM .	neutral	1
451	Great ! So it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters !	neutral	1
452	Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don ’ t have to worry about that yet . Let ’ s go make your first depot	neutral	3
453	OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal .	happiness	4
454	Is this where I can catch a bus to the theater ?	neutral	2
455	Yes , but you can't get there with out a change .	neutral	1
456	Which bus do I have to change ?	neutral	2
457	You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 .	neutral	1
458	I see . Thank you .	happiness	1
459	Here we are , Joan . This is the Palace museum , also known as the Forbidden city .	neutral	1
460	Oh , how splendid ! Can you take a picture of me here ?	happiness	3
461	Sure .	neutral	4
462	Excuse me . I'm afraid I got lost . Where am I on this map ?	neutral	2
463	We are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city .	neutral	1
464	Oh ! Can I go from here to the Zhongshan Park ?	neutral	2
465	Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right .	neutral	1
466	Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ?	neutral	3
467	Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month .	neutral	1
468	Is there anything else ? How about my salary ?	neutral	2
469	Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record .	neutral	1
470	Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ?	neutral	3
471	All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days .	neutral	1
472	Okay , that's good . I get it .	happiness	1
473	Kate , you never believe what's happened .	surprise	1
474	What do you mean ?	neutral	3
475	Masha and Hero are getting divorced .	neutral	4
476	You are kidding . What happened ?	surprise	2
477	Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce .	neutral	1
478	That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ?	surprise	2
479	Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out .	neutral	1
480	That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ?	neutral	2
481	Early in the New Year I guess .	neutral	1
482	Overseas operator .	neutral	1
483	I would like to make a collect call to Taipei , Taiwan , please .	neutral	3
484	Your name , please .	neutral	3
485	Tim Chen .	neutral	4
486	What's the number , please .	neutral	3
487	The area code is 2 , and the number is 2367-9960 .	neutral	4
488	The line is connected . Please go ahead .	happiness	4
489	Hello . Excuse me .	neutral	1
490	Yes . Can I help you ?	neutral	2
491	Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago .	neutral	2
492	Of course I remember you .	neutral	1
493	I think I lost my wallet here .	neutral	1
494	Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything .	surprise	2
495	Really ? You didn't find a wallet ?	surprise	2
496	No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ?	neutral	3
497	Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ?	neutral	2
498	No . It's been empty the whole time .	neutral	1
499	Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened .	neutral	1
500	I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ?	neutral	2
501	No . My friend did .	neutral	1
502	Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ?	neutral	2
503	No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table .	neutral	1
504	Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home .	neutral	1
505	I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ?	neutral	2
506	Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that .	neutral	3
507	Should I call the police ?	neutral	2
508	You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets .	neutral	1
509	Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home .	neutral	1
510	I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir .	neutral	1
511	Thanks for your help .	neutral	1
512	Good morning , young lady . You can call me Ma . Do you see anything you like ?	neutral	2
513	Yes . Many things ! I especially love this beautiful quilt .	happiness	1
514	That quilt was passed down to me from my ma in Holland .	neutral	1
515	It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ?	happiness	2
516	Well , this home is too big for me now , so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . Therefore , I need to part with a few things .	neutral	1
517	Oh , I see . Umm , how much do you want for the quilt ?	neutral	2
518	Is fifteen dollars OK ?	neutral	2
519	Have you got change for a thousand ?	neutral	2
520	Let me see .	neutral	1
521	May I come in , Mr Sun ?	neutral	3
522	I ’ d rather you didn ’ t , Miss Yang . I ’ m very busy now .	neutral	4
523	Can I try later then ?	neutral	3
524	Yes , of course .	neutral	4
525	Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ?	neutral	2
526	Well , uh ... I ’ m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ?	neutral	2
527	Do you mind if I sit down ?	neutral	3
528	Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ?	neutral	4
529	I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ?	neutral	3
530	Yes . But why should you want to do that ?	neutral	2
531	Do you mind if I speak frankly ?	neutral	3
532	Not at all . Go ahead .	neutral	4
533	Well . You see , I don ’ t like the office . I don ’ t like the staff . And I ’ m afraid of you . And I don ’ t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ?	neutral	3
534	Yes . I ’ d be delighted if you did .	neutral	4
535	Where is that ?	neutral	2
536	Take me to the airport , please .	neutral	3
537	Are you in a hurry ?	neutral	2
538	I have to be there before 17 o'clock .	neutral	1
539	We'll make it except a jam . You know it's rush hour .	neutral	1
540	There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .	neutral	3
541	I'll do my best .	neutral	4
542	Here's twenty dollars .	neutral	1
543	Do you have small bills ?	neutral	2
544	No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ?	neutral	3
545	Here is your receipt . Thank you .	happiness	4
546	Recently I have been getting headache and my eyes don't seems to see focus properly .	neutral	1
547	When did you last time have your eyes checked ?	neutral	2
548	Two years ago . At that time I had no problems.Now I can ’ t even make out something ten meters away .	neutral	1
549	Come over here . I will test your eyes . First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can , telling me which way the “ E ” points .	neutral	3
550	All right .	neutral	4
551	Good.Now the other eye .	neutral	3
552	Well , this one is worse .	neutral	4
553	Never mind , just read as far as you can .	neutral	3
554	I can only read the first three lines .	neutral	4
555	Is there a car park near the supermarket ?	neutral	2
556	Yes , there is an underground car park near the supermarket .	neutral	1
557	I see . Thanks .	happiness	1
558	Oh , come on , Ultraman !	anger	1
559	What's up , Bro ? What's in the bulletin ?	neutral	2
560	It says that there will be a blackout from 5 p . m . to 7 p . m . in our neighborhood today .	neutral	1
561	Blackout ? Even the TV has the limit .	neutral	2
562	Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?	neutral	2
563	Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either !	anger	1
564	That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ?	neutral	2
565	Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner !	fear	1
566	OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here .	neutral	3
567	How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ?	neutral	3
568	Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl .	neutral	4
569	Do you have a better plan ?	neutral	2
570	All right , all right .	neutral	1
571	Yes , ma'am , how could I help you ?	neutral	2
572	I am wondering if you do facial care ?	neutral	2
573	Yes , we do .	neutral	1
574	How much would it be ?	neutral	2
575	From 200 to 800 .	neutral	1
576	I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ?	neutral	3
577	No problem .	neutral	4
578	Can I help you , Miss ?	neutral	2
579	I would like to order 2 office-style cabinets and desk calendars . We want office-style cabinets in white . The catalogue number is 90 - f - 2356 .	neutral	3

583	Please handle the items carefully .	neutral	3
584	Certainly .	neutral	4
585	We will pay by collect on delivery .	neutral	1
586	I hate to do this to you , Alice , but I ’ m going to have to ask you to put in some more overtime .	neutral	3
587	Does it have to be this afternoon , Mr . Fairbanks ? I ’ Ve already made plans .	neutral	3
588	Well , I would have preferred to do it today , but if you ’ Ve already made plans , we can do it tomorrow .	neutral	4
589	I ’ d appreciate that , sir . How long do you think you ’ ll need me to stay ?	neutral	3
590	What ’ s your attitude when do wrong things at work ?	neutral	2
591	The buck stops here .	neutral	1
592	Hello ! Is your company advertising for administrative assistant on the newspapers ?	neutral	2
593	Well , Administrative assistant with shorthand and typing skills are badly needed here .	neutral	1
594	First I want to check about the availability and see if you could give me more information .	neutral	3
595	The position calls for a person with some working experience . We must be able to benefit from your analytical and interpersonal skills . Can you deliver your resume to us first ?	neutral	3
596	Of course . I will deliver my resume to you in minutes ' time . I hope you will consider my application and I shall appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience .	neutral	3
597	OK . I will call you soon . Bye now .	neutral	4
598	Bye .	neutral	1
599	Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview .	neutral	1
600	It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time .	neutral	1
601	You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview .	neutral	1
602	The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation .	neutral	1
603	Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation .	neutral	1
604	To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression .	neutral	1
605	Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief .	neutral	1
606	It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn .	neutral	1
607	You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for .	neutral	1
608	While you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately	neutral	1
609	Time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description .	neutral	1
610	Besides , in the interview , it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly .	neutral	1
611	Hello ?	neutral	1
612	Hi , Deborah ! This is John . I'm calling from Australia .	neutral	1
613	What are you doing in Australia ?	neutral	2
614	I'm attending a conference in Sydney this week . Remember ?	neutral	2
615	Oh , right . What time is it there ?	neutral	2
616	It's 10:00 P . M . And it's four o'clock in Los Angeles , right ?	neutral	2
617	Yes - four o'clock in the morning .	neutral	1
618	4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry .	happiness	2
619	That's OK . I'm awake now .	happiness	1
620	John hasn't turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ?	neutral	2
621	I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement .	neutral	3
622	Jack , let ’ s go !	fear	3
623	Oh , you are out of breath ! What happened ?	neutral	2
624	Some people are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave here as soon as possible !	fear	1
625	Take it easy . They will get caught .	neutral	4
626	Hello . May I speak to Jerry , please ?	neutral	3
627	Sorry , but he is out for lunch right now .	sadness	4
628	I see . Can you give me some idea how long he'll be back ?	neutral	3
629	I think he will be back around 2:00 . If you like , please leave your name and phone number , I'll have him call you as soon as he comes back .	neutral	4
630	That's nice . My name is Steven , my phone number is 6789777 . Okay , I'll be waiting for his call . Thank you and bye !	happiness	1
631	My pleasure , bye !	happiness	1
632	Excuse me , Miss .	neutral	3
633	What can I do for you ?	neutral	2
634	I've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed .	neutral	1
635	What's your flight number ?	neutral	2
636	Flight CA216 to Chengdu .	neutral	1
637	Yes , it's true . It has been delayed .	neutral	1
638	Could you please tell me why ?	neutral	3
639	Yes , of course . The delay is due to heavy rain .	neutral	4
640	How long will the delay be ? Do you have any further information about it ?	neutral	2
641	I am sorry , we don't know the extent of the delay at present . But according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon .	neutral	1
642	We have to wait . Well , is it possible for the rain to stop before noon ?	neutral	2
643	It's hard to say . Weather is so changeable in the summer . Please listen to the latest announcement about your flight .	neutral	1
644	Yes , I will . Thanks a lot . Bye !	neutral	1
645	Bye	neutral	1
646	What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !	anger	2
647	I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .	neutral	1
648	I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !	anger	2
649	I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ?	neutral	2
650	I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .	neutral	1
651	Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?	neutral	2
652	I don't know .	neutral	1
653	I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .	neutral	1
654	What do you mean ?	neutral	2
655	We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .	neutral	1
656	I have plenty of gas .	neutral	1
657	Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .	neutral	1
658	So what can we do ?	neutral	2
659	Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible .	neutral	3
660	Alright . That's a good idea .	happiness	4
661	I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .	neutral	1
662	Days ?	neutral	2
663	Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .	neutral	1
664	Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .	surprise	1
665	Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .	neutral	1
666	Hey , buddy , can ’ t you see there ’ s a line ?	neutral	2
667	Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t know .	sadness	1
668	What ? You haven ’ t taken the bus before ?	neutral	2
669	No , I ’ m afraid not .	sadness	1
670	Well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . Besides , you should let old people on first .	neutral	3
671	Sorry .	neutral	4
672	It ’ s all right . Where are you going ?	neutral	2
673	I wanted to see the White House .	neutral	1
674	Oh , well you don ’ t want this bus , anyway . It goes to Georgetown .	neutral	1
675	Oh , no .	neutral	1
676	It ’ s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A .	neutral	3
677	Oh , well thank you very much .	happiness	4
678	You ’ re welcome .	happiness	1
679	Can I help you ?	neutral	2
680	I'd like the double cheese burger meal , please .	neutral	3
681	What kind of drink would you like with that ?	neutral	2
682	Just coke will be fine .	neutral	1
683	Would you like a super size meal ? Only 2 RIB more , you'll get large coke and fries instead of medium . And today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes .	neutral	3
684	That sounds good , thanks , I'd like that . Actually I'd like sprite instead of coke , thanks .	happiness	4
685	That's not a problem , Miss . Will that be it ?	neutral	2
686	Yes , that's all .	neutral	1
687	That will be 25RMB , please	neutral	3
688	You got it .	neutral	4
689	Do you have any night tours ?	neutral	2
690	Yes , we will depart in 10 minutes .	neutral	1
691	Is that a guided tour ?	neutral	2
692	Yes , it is .	neutral	1
693	That's fine . Let's get on the bus .	neutral	3
694	I am sure we will make it up as soon as possible .	neutral	3
695	That's nice .	neutral	4
696	We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings .	neutral	3
697	Of course not . We have cooperated for a long time .	neutral	4
698	I would like to purchase some meat .	neutral	3
699	What kind of meat would you like to get today ?	neutral	2
700	First off , I'm going to need a pound of ground beef .	neutral	3
701	A pound of ground beef is $ 2.48 .	neutral	1
702	That's perfect .	neutral	1
703	What else will you be needing ?	neutral	2
704	I'm also going to need three pounds of chicken breasts .	neutral	3
705	The chicken breasts cost $ 4.05 per pound .	neutral	1
706	What's the total price for the chicken ?	neutral	2
707	It's going to be $ 12.15 .	neutral	1
708	Okay , I think that will be all for me today .	happiness	1
709	I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks .	neutral	3
710	Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us .	neutral	4
711	Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market .	surprise	2
712	Do you sell direct to shops ?	neutral	2
713	Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen .	neutral	1
714	Do you keep a stock of these things ?	neutral	2
715	In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course .	neutral	1
716	That is , your commission .	neutral	1
717	Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal .	neutral	1
718	Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission .	neutral	1
719	The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much .	neutral	1
720	According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ?	neutral	2
721	We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with .	neutral	3
722	We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ...	neutral	4
723	Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ?	neutral	2
724	Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect .	neutral	1
725	Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products .	neutral	1
726	Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details .	neutral	3
727	Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ?	neutral	2
728	Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction .	neutral	3
729	All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency .	neutral	4
730	Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair .	neutral	1
731	Excuse me , I ’ m sorry to trouble you . My name is Susan Ransom , and I have placed several orders with you company .	neutral	1
732	Yes , Mr . Ransom ? This is Karl Miller . How may I help you ?	neutral	3
733	Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn ’ t arrived yet .	neutral	3
734	Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ?	neutral	2
735	Have you worked out the offers . Mr . Thou ?	neutral	2
736	Yes , we have . Here's our CIF quotation sheet . Please have a careful look .	neutral	3
737	Are the prices on the list firm offers ?	neutral	2
738	Yes . All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation .	neutral	1
739	I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices .	neutral	2
740	All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ?	neutral	1
741	How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan .	neutral	2
742	I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days .	neutral	1
743	Hello sir , may I help you ?	neutral	2
744	Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .	neutral	3
745	I see . Well , you have come to the right place . We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers .	neutral	4
746	Sounds good . I don ’ t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range .	happiness	1
747	We have this new ETC smart phone.It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications . It also has a built-in camera , mp3 player and touch screen . It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are .	neutral	1
748	What about Wi-fi ?	neutral	2
749	Of course ! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home .	neutral	1
750	One last thing . Is it waterproof ?	neutral	2
751	We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet !	anger	3
752	Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty !	anger	4
753	Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?	neutral	2
754	I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard !	anger	1
755	What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .	neutral	2
756	Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ?	neutral	3
757	We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .	neutral	4
758	Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !	neutral	3
759	I ’ ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there .	neutral	4
760	Yay !	happiness	1
761	Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ?	neutral	3
762	Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ’ t understand .	neutral	1
763	From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ’ s overbooked .	neutral	1
764	I know what overbooked is , I just don ’ t understand how that could happen ?	neutral	1
765	Actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats ,	neutral	1
766	So who has to stay behind ?	neutral	2
767	Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone .	neutral	1
768	Ok . I ’ ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket !	neutral	4
769	I want to rent this apartment .	neutral	3
770	I ’ m glad to hear that .	happiness	4
771	How much are you asking ?	neutral	2
772	You will have to pay $ 1050 every month .	neutral	1
773	I can ’ t afford that .	neutral	1
774	What can you afford ?	neutral	2
775	I was thinking $ 800 a month .	neutral	1
776	I ’ ll need you to pay more than that .	neutral	1
777	How much more ?	neutral	2
778	How does $ 900 every month sound to you ?	neutral	3
779	I can live with that .	neutral	4
780	We have a deal then .	happiness	1
781	Good morning , Miss Monica . Nice to meet you again !	happiness	1
782	Good morning , Mr . Thomas , it is nice to see you too .	happiness	1
783	After the internal discussion , we have all agreed that you are the most suitable person for this position among all the candidates . So , today let ’ s talk about your expected salary and social benefits . What is your expected salary ?	neutral	2
784	I ’ Ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . Depend on my work qualifications and experience , I would like to have 5000 Yuan to start .	neutral	3
785	The basic salary for your position in our company would be 4800 Yuan to start with increases giving according to your performance .	neutral	1
786	It is a bit lower than I expected . But I can accept that . What are the working hours ?	neutral	2
787	40 hours a week , Monday to Friday , 9 AM to 5 PM with one hour lunch break every day ..	neutral	1
788	Do I have to work on weekend ? If so , how do you pay for the overtime ?	neutral	2
789	We do expect overtime work when it is necessary , but we pay twice of the work hour for working on weekends and three times for working on national holidays like Spring Festival and the Mid-Autumn Day .	neutral	3
790	Is there probation ?	neutral	2
791	No probation is involved . If you feel good , you can start next week .	neutral	3
792	Welcome to the McDonald's . What will it be for you , madam ?	neutral	2
793	One Big Mac and French Fries .	neutral	1
794	Is there anything else ?	neutral	2
795	Give me one coke , please .	neutral	1
796	Is this to go or to eat here ?	neutral	2
797	To go , please .	neutral	1
798	That comes to four dollars and ten cents .	neutral	1
799	And can I have some ketchup , please ?	neutral	3
800	It's on the service counter over there . Please go to help yourself .	neutral	4
801	What's the name of this street ?	neutral	2
802	University Street .	neutral	1
803	Do you know of any banks near here ?	neutral	2
804	You'll see one at the corner on your right .	neutral	1
805	Hey there , you look a little lost . Are you new here ?	neutral	2
806	Yeah how ’ d you know ?	neutral	2
807	You can always spot the newbies . I can give you a few pointers if you want . Were you trying to use this machine here ?	neutral	2
808	Yeah ! I just started my training today and I ’ m not really sure where to begin .	neutral	1
809	It ’ s ok , I know how it is . This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ?	neutral	2
810	Well , I don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio .	neutral	1
811	In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .	neutral	3
812	Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ’ s a lot of weight !	surprise	2
813	It ’ s not that much . Just watch ... I ’ m ok ...	neutral	1
814	Excuse me.Could you tell me how to return to the Hilton Hotel ? I am afraid I lost my way .	neutral	3
815	Do you have a hotel card or something ?	neutral	2
816	Let's see.Yes , I have the address and telephone number here .	neutral	1
817	Oh , you're staying at the downtown Hilton.Then , you go down two blocks this way and turn left.You ' ll find it on the right .	neutral	3
818	Well , I don't understand it very well.Will you draw me a map ?	neutral	3
819	Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ?	neutral	3
820	The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street .	neutral	4
821	How long will it take me to get there ?	neutral	2
822	It's about a ten-minute walk .	neutral	1
823	That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .	happiness	1
824	Not at all .	happiness	1
825	How does the political system work in your country ?	neutral	2
826	We have hundreds of constituencies and the voters in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ’ s .	neutral	1
827	Each mp belongs to a political party , right ?	neutral	2
828	Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime Finist	neutral	1
829	What ’ s a cabinet ?	neutral	2
830	This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ’ s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .	neutral	1
831	Can any mp make a law ?	neutral	2
832	Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law .	neutral	1
833	I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .	neutral	1
834	Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to .	neutral	1
835	How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?	neutral	2
836	They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Voters who often change the party they vote for are Calle	neutral	1
837	How was your interview ?	neutral	2
838	Pretty good . The HR manager asked me the usual questions . Then he wondered why I had decided to leave my previous job .	neutral	1
839	What did you say ?	neutral	2
840	I told him that I hadn ’ t got a raise for three years . I also told him that one of my best co-workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years .	neutral	1
841	Did he want to know the reasons ?	neutral	2
842	Yes . I told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession . But I thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only .	neutral	1
843	That ’ s sex discrimination . When will you get the reply ?	neutral	2
844	In a couple of days , I was told .	neutral	1
845	Wish you good luck !	happiness	1
846	Thank you .	happiness	1

856	So , what's the problem ?	neutral	2
857	I need souvenirs !	neutral	1
858	You want some souvenirs !	neutral	2
859	Yes , yes . Souvenirs .	neutral	1
860	But , sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items .	neutral	3
861	That's not the same thing . If you buy hotel souvenirs , they have no sentimental value .	neutral	4
862	I understand , sir . I'll call housekeeping . You'll have your souvenirs shortly .	neutral	4
863	Hello , may I help you ?	neutral	2
864	Yes.We ' re interested in seeing the rooms for rent .	neutral	3

875	No , I want the fish .	neutral	4
876	Our special tonight is lobster .	neutral	3
877	Thank you , but I prefer the fish .	neutral	4
878	Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb .	neutral	3
879	No , I like the fish .	neutral	4
880	What ever you say ?	neutral	1
881	Am I ever hungry ? When will supper be ready ?	neutral	2

887	Definitely . It's a wonderful meal . Thank you , Honey .	surprise	1
888	If you like to help me do the dishes , I'll be more dreadful .	happiness	3
889	I wish I could , but I won't .	neutral	4
890	Good morning , Kate . Long time no see .	neutral	1
891	Good morning , Vera , Nice to meet you .	neutral	1
892	Kate , I know you ’ Ve been a stewardess for more than one year . And I ’ ll have an interview on stewardess tomorrow . Can you tell me some etiquette about the interview ?	neutral	3
893	Of course . First you should do up your long hair and do make up but not too thick .	neutral	3
894	Is there anything else I should pay attention to ?	neutral	2
895	Yes , when you attend the interview , you should pay attention to your manner , style of conversation and expression . You should keep smiling always , being polite when you talk with the interviewer . Don't move from time to time when you sit there . And you also should know how to use eye contact .	neutral	3

898	Can you fix me a cup of tea , Johnny ?	neutral	3
899	Well ... uh ... how about a glass of juice instead ?	neutral	3
900	No . I'd like tea . Can you put it in my favorite cup ? You probably washed it ...	neutral	3

919	You really should go to Rachel's pet store .	neutral	1
920	why ? anything special there ?	surprise	2
921	it's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .	neutral	1

931	I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .	neutral	3
932	oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .	neutral	4

994	Hello . I'd like to speak to someone regarding my card .	neutral	3
995	Sorry , I'm not quite sure if I understand . In what way , Sir ? Has your card been stolen ?	neutral	2
996	No , no . Nothing at all like that . It's just that I applied for a credit card with you a while ago , my application was accepted , but I'm still waiting for my card .	neutral	1
997	Oh , I see , Sir . Well , it does take 5 working days to issue and post the card .	neutral	1

1009	Of course , sir .	neutral	4

1011	You should do one of the two things - either to lodge a claim with the shipowner or with the insurance company .	neutral	3
1012	Shall we leave it to the brokers ?	neutral	2
1013	Yes . They usually do it .	neutral	1
1014	Do they charge for that ?	neutral	2
1015	Of course . In Europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service .	neutral	1
1016	Is it the same in America ?	neutral	2
1017	They do the work without charge to the importer .	neutral	1
1018	It's part of their service , isn't it ?	neutral	2
1019	Exactly .	neutral	1
1020	Is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ?	neutral	2
1021	No , you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment .	neutral	1
1022	I see . By the way , how do we prove the ownership of our goods ?	neutral	2
1023	You must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice .	neutral	1
1024	I see . Thank you .	happiness	1
1025	You are welcome .	happiness	1
1026	I'll be on business for a couple of days , could you take care of your sister ?	neutral	3
1027	OK , Mum , when will you be back ?	neutral	2
1028	I'll be back in ten days .	neutral	1

1032	All right . Shall I enter all my belongings ?	neutral	3
1033	No , only the articles listed on the Declaration .	neutral	4
1034	I ’ m hungry , let ’ s go grab a bite to eat .	neutral	3
1035	Yeah me too . Oh ! Can we stop at the shop really fast ? I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things .	neutral	3
1036	Will you take long ?	neutral	2
1037	No ! Five minutes I promise !	neutral	1
1038	Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish !	anger	1
1039	Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation , liquid foundation .	neutral	2
1040	Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon !	anger	2
1041	What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ...	anger	2
1042	Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon !	anger	3
1043	Can I borrow five bucks ?	neutral	3
1044	No !	neutral	4
1045	Come on ! I'll pay you back on Tuesday .	anger	3

1047	I promise if you lend me five dollars today , I will repay you in full next week .	neutral	3
1048	Ok , but I'm taking your skateboard as collateral .	neutral	4
1049	Fine ! I can't believe you don't trust me .	anger	1
1050	It's nothing personal , just business .	neutral	1
1051	May I help you , sir ?	neutral	2
1052	Yes , please . I'm looking for a cotton polo shirt .	neutral	3
1053	Any particular colour ?	neutral	2
1054	Not really .	neutral	1
1055	How about this one ?	neutral	3
1056	I like the design , but don't particularly care for the colour . Do you have that in other colours , too ?	neutral	2
1057	Well , they come in white , pale yellow , aqua , red and green . Will a white one do ?	neutral	2
1058	Yes . I prefer white - and may I see a pale yellow one , too ?	neutral	3

1063	Thank you .	happiness	1
1064	How do you keep fit ?	neutral	2
1065	I do yoga twice a weeks	neutral	1
1066	Yoga ? It sounds interesting .	happiness	1
1067	It was hard at the beginning , but now feel it's really relaxing . It makes me flexible .	neutral	1
1068	Anything else ?	neutral	2
1069	Yes , I often go swimming .	neutral	1
1070	Are you interested in swimming ?	neutral	2
1071	Yes , I like it very much .	happiness	1
1072	Are you going home now ?	neutral	2
1073	No , I'm not .	neutral	1
1074	What are you going to do ? Are you going to work late ?	neutral	2
1075	No , I'm not . I'm going to look for an apartment .	neutral	1
1076	An apartment ? Why ?	surprise	2
1077	I'm going to try to find a place near the office .	neutral	1
1078	Where are you living now ?	neutral	2
1079	Out in the suburbs . It's a long trip to work every day .	neutral	1
1080	How are you going to find an apartment ?	neutral	2
1081	I'm going to buy a newspaper and check the classified ads .	neutral	1
1082	Apartments in the city are expensive .	neutral	1
1083	I know , but I'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management .	neutral	1
1084	no , no , you helped me with my computer last week . I want to repay the favor .	neutral	3

1090	What ’ s wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ?	neutral	2
1091	Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ?	neutral	1
1092	Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .	neutral	3
1093	Hey , Jim . It's time to wake up and get out of bed .	neutral	3
1094	Do I have to get up now ?	neutral	2

1115	Sit down , please . What's wrong with you ?	neutral	2
1116	I feel cold , and I'm shivering . I have a terrible headache and a sore throat .	neutral	1
1117	How long have you been like that ?	neutral	2
1118	About a day .	neutral	1
1119	"Let me have a look at your throat first . Please open your mouth and say "" ah "" ."	neutral	3
1120	Ah ...	neutral	4
1121	And show me your tongue ... Thank you . That'll do . You have slight tonsillitis , and your throat is inflamed . How is your appetite ?	neutral	2
1122	Not so good .	neutral	1
1123	Now , let me take your temperature . Please put this thermometer under your armpit and let me feel your pulse ?	neutral	3
1124	Your pulse is weak .	neutral	1
1125	Do I have a temperature , doctor ?	neutral	2
1126	Yes , you have a high fever . I'd like to give you a blood test .	neutral	3
1127	Yikes ! What was that noise ?	surprise	2
1128	I had to blow my nose .	neutral	1
1129	Did you have to blow right next to the phone ?	neutral	2
1130	Did you hear that ?	neutral	2
1131	Of course I heard that . I thought a plane had crashed into your house .	neutral	1
1132	It wasn't that loud .	neutral	1
1133	I will blow my nose sometime for you , and you'll see .	neutral	1
1134	Okay . I'll take your word for it .	neutral	1
1135	I thought you had an elephant in your house .	surprise	1
1136	You're funny .	neutral	1
1137	What did you say ? I think I've gone deaf .	neutral	2
1138	I'm going into the bathroom to blow my nose . I'll be right back .	neutral	1

1142	Yes , sir , it is .	neutral	1
1143	Thank you , the service was good	happiness	1
1144	Please come again .	happiness	1
1145	Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive .	neutral	1
1146	What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them .	neutral	1
1147	But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past .	neutral	1
1148	Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds .	neutral	1
1149	Okay , well I ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position .	neutral	1
1150	Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify .	neutral	1
1151	Well feel free to ask me anything , and I ’ ll try to fill in the details .	neutral	3
1152	Could I first ask about the remuneration package ?	neutral	3
1153	Yes , of course . That ’ s quite an important point , isn ’ t it ? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum . This doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance also .	neutral	1
1154	I understand . And are there other bonuses included ?	neutral	2
1155	Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . But we could go through all the details of that at a later date .	neutral	1
1156	Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me .	neutral	1
1157	Excellent . Well , what other questions do you have Rebecca ?	neutral	2
1158	We need to take the accounts system offline to carry out the upgrade . But don't worry , it won't cause too much inconvenience . We're going to do it over the weekend .	neutral	1
1159	How long will the system be down for ?	neutral	2
1160	We'll be taking everything offline in about two hours ' time . It'll be down for a minimum of twelve hours . If everything goes according to plan , it should be up again by 6 pm on Saturday .	neutral	1
1161	That's fine . We've allowed forty-eight hours to be on the safe side .	neutral	1
1162	Welcome to IBA . Can I help you ?	neutral	2
1163	Yes , please . I'm here for an International Settlement . Our company has to effect payment , and it needs to be done today . Here's the advice slip for the payment .	neutral	3
1164	Thanks . I'm sorry to say that you need to get this stamped . There is no stamp on this slip and it is essential before I can process it for you .	neutral	3
1165	I see . So , I need to stamp it . And sign it too ?	neutral	2
1166	Yes , that's right . Down here , at the bottom right hand corner to show that you agree to pay the printed amount .	neutral	3

1168	That's the warehouse where the large items of office equipment are stored .	neutral	1
1169	If I ordered a desk today , how would it be before I got delivery in Scotland ?	neutral	2
1170	Well , I think perhaps you'd better speak to our Production Manager , Mr . Yao . You'll meet him when we go over to the factory .	neutral	3
1171	Excuse me . I have just missed the connection plane due to the heavy fog in London . Can I change my ticket now ?	neutral	2

1205	You'll only have to pay for the monthly sticker .	neutral	1
1206	How much is the monthly sticker ?	neutral	2
1207	It's $ 24 for each month .	neutral	1
1208	I'll take the student bus pass .	neutral	3

1222	I'm not getting one .	neutral	1
1223	Why is that ?	neutral	2
1224	It's cheaper if I don't buy one .	neutral	1
1225	Buying a bus pass will save you money .	neutral	1
1226	How do you figure that ?	neutral	2
1227	There's no limit to how often you can use your bus pass .	neutral	1

1305	I hope you can help . I've got a bit of a problem with your ATM .	neutral	3
1306	Of course , that's my job . Oh , dear . What's happened ?	neutral	2
1307	Well , it's eaten my card ! It won't give it back !	neutral	4
1308	I see ... calm down , don't worry . May I ask what were you doing when it took your card ?	neutral	3
1309	Yes . I was only entering my PIN . I'm terrible at remembering it , I'm so forgetful , you see .	neutral	1
1310	Mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it , please ?	neutral	2
1311	Maybe three times . As I said , I always forget it .	neutral	1
1312	Ah ! Don't worry ; it's just a security measure . If someone uses a card and cannot get the right PIN after three attempts , the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen . Just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you .	neutral	3
1313	Oh , I see . So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me ?	neutral	2
1314	Yes , they'll be happy to help . Believe me , it happens to many people .	neutral	1

1344	Yes , I'm glad we've had very pleasant cooperation in the previous years . And your achievement for promoting our clothes was great in the three years .	neutral	1
1345	So , I wish to apply for the sole agency of your product in our local market . If you give us the agency , that will be more substantial for our cooperation .	neutral	3
1346	To be frank , you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country . I'd like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent .	neutral	3
1347	As we are a well-established company , we are very familiar with the customers ' needs . Besides , we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent .	neutral	1
1348	Sounds reasonable . I will tell my boss about you agent application . Another question , what do you think is the minimum annual sales you can guarantee ?	neutral	2
1349	To be on the safe side , and for garment of all materials , sizes , and styles , I think the amount will be 50,000 pieces a year .	neutral	1
1350	Well . As our sole agency , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own .	neutral	3
1351	No , certainly not .	neutral	4
1352	Excuse me .	neutral	1
1353	Yes ?	neutral	2
1354	I bought this circulator here yesterday but it doesn't work .	neutral	1
1355	Oh , let's see what's wrong .	neutral	3
1356	Where can I find the produce ?	neutral	2
1357	Aisle A is where you'll find all the produce .	neutral	1
1358	What sales do they have today ?	neutral	2
1359	I'm sure something is on sale . Please check with the produce person .	neutral	3
1360	Hello , this is Steven from Blue Sky Co . May I speak to Mr . James ?	neutral	3

1363	Yeah , exactly ! I bought them last year . En ... at present , they are still in good state .	neutral	1
1364	That's it ! All of them have first-class quality and performance . Besides , we adopt advanced technology . Now we have developed new products . They are much better than what you have bought .	neutral	1
1365	Your company is developing so fast . Maybe later on I will plan to buy more .	neutral	1
1366	That's great ! Thanks for your support . If any , please remember to call us . I am afraid I have to say goodbye now ! Bye , Mr . James !	happiness	1
1367	Bye !	neutral	1

1373	Sir , does this apply to intra-office communications only ? Or will it also restrict external communications ?	neutral	2
1374	It should apply to all communications , not only in this office between employees , but also any outside communications .	neutral	1
1375	But sir , many employees use Instant Messaging to communicate with their clients .	neutral	1
1376	They will just have to change their communication methods . I don't want any - one using Instant Messaging in this office.It wastes too much time ! Now , please continue with the memo.Where were we ?	neutral	3

1383	This is Dunlin . Is this Mrs Smith speaking ?	neutral	2
1384	Yes , what can I do for you ?	neutral	2
1385	I just want to call and say thank you for letting me interview yesterday .	neutral	1
1386	You are welcome , Mr . Sun .	neutral	1
1387	And I also want to know what the status is of the position .	neutral	1
1388	Sorry , we haven't made the decision at all . But we should be making the decision by the end of this week . And we'll get in touch with you once we make it .	neutral	3
1389	Do you have any questions we didn't cover in the interview ?	neutral	2
1390	No .	neutral	1
1391	Thank you , I am looking forward to hearing from you . Bye-bye .	neutral	1
1392	Thank you for the calling . Bye-bye .	neutral	1
1393	I often sneeze after having a bad itch inside my nose . Sometimes this is accompanied by an itching throat .	neutral	1
1394	Any other discomfort ?	neutral	2
1395	Yes . Sometimes I can notice a constriction in the chest and shortness of breath after a fit of sneezing . And I often suffer from a running nose with a profuse watery discharge .	neutral	1
1396	Does it occur seasonally or all year round ?	neutral	2
1397	It has been seasonal during these past three years .	neutral	1
1398	Are you sensitive to other things ?	neutral	2
1399	Yes , things like seafood and penicillin-type drugs .	neutral	1
1400	OK . Let me examine your nose . According to your case history and the examination , I believe that it's allergic rhinitis .	neutral	3
1401	What useful treatment can you offer ?	neutral	2
1402	I'll give you a series of specific skin tests . Then we'll know exactly what substances you're allergic to . Then I'll give you some causes of desensitization therapy .	neutral	3
1403	Miss , would you like to try this free sample of our new suntan cream ?	neutral	3
1404	Sure , why not ?	happiness	4
1405	This is a new product of company this year . It's oil-free .	neutral	1
1406	I see . It feels very light on the skin .	happiness	1
1407	It gives your skin a very natural healthy look .	neutral	1
1408	I like the cool smell , too .	happiness	1
1409	So how can I make it ?	neutral	2
1410	First you make a list of what you wanna buy ...	neutral	3
1411	But I ’ Ve gotta have the budge before anything else .	neutral	4
1412	Well , that ’ s a problem , isn ’ t it ?	neutral	2
1413	Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ?	neutral	2
1414	No , I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ?	neutral	2
1415	Yeah , I worked about twenty hours a week in a pizza restaurant .	neutral	1
1416	What was that like ?	neutral	2
1417	It was always very busy there .	neutral	1
1418	What did you do ?	neutral	2
1419	I stood behind the register and took pizza orders .	neutral	1
1420	Did you get any perks on the job ?	neutral	2

1430	How would you like your bills ?	neutral	2
1431	In fifties please .	neutral	1
1432	Why are you reading the classifieds ? What do you need ?	neutral	2
1433	I'm looking for a bookcase , but I don't want to buy a new one .	neutral	1
1434	Are you having any luck ?	neutral	2
1435	Not really . There aren't any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I'll go to them .	neutral	1
1436	Do you mind if I go with you ?	neutral	3
1437	Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .	neutral	4
1438	I learned to negotiate from my mother . I thought I was pretty good at bargaining , but I had a problem the other day at Kimble's Department Store .	neutral	1
1439	What happened ?	neutral	2
1440	I wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . It was priced at forty dollars , so I started by offering the salesclerk thirty .	neutral	1
1441	Do you do a lot of your shopping online ?	neutral	1
1442	Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but lat	neutral	1
1443	No . I ’ m a little worried about security . You never know who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ?	neutral	2
1444	Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to sho	neutral	1
1445	I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological .	neutral	1
1446	I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people .	neutral	1
1447	So , how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .	neutral	3
1448	Sure . I ’ d love to join you . Can we stop by the computer store ? I just want to see if they have something .	neutral	3

1450	Ok . I ’ Ve finished online . Let ’ s go . I ’ ll just get some money and my credit card .	neutral	3
1451	Thanks for reminding me . I had forgotten to get mine .	neutral	4
1452	Please help yourself at your dishes . I hope you ’ ll enjoy what you ’ Ve got .	neutral	3
1453	It suits my taste . You are really a good cook .	happiness	4
1454	Would you like to try my special recipe ?	neutral	3
1455	Wow , let me try . It tastes nice . How did you make it ?	neutral	2
1456	It ’ s as easy as pie . I always follow recipes .	neutral	1
1457	Mr . Dick . Does the recommendation of the university play an important role ?	neutral	2
1458	Yes . In fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation . In the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . If your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily .	neutral	1
1459	But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority .	neutral	1
1460	More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . If your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you .	neutral	3
1461	Could you tell me whether or not I send out my resume with it ?	neutral	2
1462	It depends . If it has something special or useful , I suggest you send it out .	neutral	3
1463	Taylor , can you tell me how to apply for a job on the Internet ?	neutral	3
1464	Just fill out an application .	neutral	3
1465	Do I have to send an E-mail ?	neutral	2
1466	You are expected to know the E-mail address of the unit .	neutral	3
1467	But I still don't know which unit is in need of staff .	neutral	1
1468	Send out an application through Job-wanted on the website .	neutral	3
1469	Can any unit see my information ?	neutral	2
1470	It's a two-way choice . And your application will be read .	neutral	1
1471	Which websites offer this service ?	neutral	2
1472	Sina , 21st Century Talent Net , and a few others .	neutral	1
1473	Thank you .	neutral	1
1474	Don ’ t throw your weight around . I can ’ t bear you any more .	anger	3
1475	I dare you to say that again .	anger	4
1476	Were you a leader when you were in college ?	neutral	2
1477	Yes . I was Propaganda department minister of our university .	neutral	1
1478	Did you get any honors or awards at your university ?	neutral	2
1479	No . It ’ s a pity about it .	neutral	1
1480	Were you involved in any club activities at your university ?	neutral	2
1481	Yes . I was a member of the basketball Society . I like playing basketball .	neutral	1
1482	What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ?	neutral	2
1483	I sometimes played basketball and sometimes played football .	neutral	1
1484	You want to argue your ticket today ?	neutral	2
1485	Yes . That is why I'm here .	neutral	1
1486	Tell me your argument .	neutral	3
1487	I was pulled over for allegedly speeding .	neutral	1
1488	Are you sure you weren't speeding ?	neutral	2
1489	To be honest , I really wasn't .	neutral	1
1490	What speed were you going ?	neutral	2
1491	I was under the speed limit . I was going 35 , when the speed limit was 40 .	neutral	1
1492	I'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer isn't here .	neutral	3
1493	What about my ticket ? Do I still need to pay ?	neutral	2
1494	Don't worry about it .	neutral	1
1495	I'm so glad for your help .	happiness	3
1496	Annie , do you like shopping online ?	neutral	2
1497	Yes , I like it , because it's convenient .	neutral	1
1498	Last week , I tried to buy a new cellphone online , but I didn't know how to pay for it .	neutral	1
1499	First , you should open an account at the online bank . After that , you can buy anything you want online .	neutral	1
1500	Are there many things online ?	neutral	2
1501	Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let's check it out online ! ( They log in a shopping website . )	neutral	1

1506	So what is it ?	neutral	2
1507	You gotta help me out this time , buddy .	neutral	3
1508	Another tough thing , I guess .	neutral	4
1509	Hey ! What happened ? ! My song was only half way through and it skipped to the next song .	surprise	2
1510	I don't know what happened !	surprise	1
1511	You cancelled the song , didn't you , Jack ?	neutral	2
1512	No , I didn't . Really !	neutral	1
1513	Then , is the machine broken or ...	neutral	2

1542	Sure , here is my driver's license .	neutral	4
1543	Please sign here .	neutral	1
1544	Are you ready to order ?	neutral	2
1545	I think that we have a pretty good idea of what we would like to order .	happiness	1
1546	Let me tell you about the specials of the day , which are chicken in a wine sauce with capers , and grilled garlic shrimp .	neutral	3
1547	I was wondering if the chef could leave off the sauce .	neutral	3
1548	The chef would be happy to accommodate your special requests .	neutral	4
1549	I am a vegetarian . Do you have any vegetarian selections ?	neutral	2
1550	You could choose the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza or the goat cheese and candied walnut salad .	neutral	3
1551	I think that we will split the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza .	neutral	3
1552	That is a good selection , and I can bring your salads now or serve them with your entree .	neutral	4
1553	You can bring us our salads when you bring us our entree .	neutral	3
1554	I can't open this email attachment our Paris office has sent me .	neutral	1
1555	Are you sure you're using the right program ?	neutral	2
1556	Well , yes it's definitely the same program but I might have the wrong version . Their system is newer than ours .	neutral	1
1557	That's why you can't open it . You'll have to upgrade before you can read the file .	neutral	3
1558	What kind of character do you think you have ?	neutral	2
1559	Generally speaking , l am an open-minded person .	neutral	1
1560	What is your strongest trait ?	neutral	2

1567	I get on well with others .	neutral	1
1568	Hi , I need to make an appointment to see the doctor .	neutral	3
1569	What seems to be the problem ?	neutral	2
1570	I have a rash that I need a doctor to look at .	neutral	3
1571	Do you have a fever with that rash ?	neutral	2
1572	No , it just itches a lot .	neutral	1
1573	I have openings on Tuesday or Wednesday . Which would be best for you ?	neutral	2
1574	I need an appointment on Tuesday .	neutral	3
1575	Fine , I am putting you down for 9	neutral	3
1576	I would like to see Dr . Jones .	neutral	3
1577	I can schedule you with him with no problem . We look forward to seeing you .	neutral	4
1578	Wow ! What's the hold up ?	surprise	2
1579	It ’ s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer .	neutral	1
1580	Really ? Then , I guess I won ’ t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?	neutral	2
1581	Actually , you might because there ’ s a big convention in town this weekend .	neutral	1
1582	I ’ m not too worried about it . I always seem to find something .	neutral	1
1583	Hello , how can I help you today ?	neutral	2
1584	I'd like to withdraw some money from my account .	neutral	3
1585	Please fill out this slip stating how much you wish to withdraw .	neutral	3
1586	Well , actually , it's quite a substantial amount . Here's my Bank Book . Will that cause a problem ?	neutral	2
1587	On your account there is no limit to over the counter withdrawals , it won't cause a problem . Here's your money , 10,000 RIB . Please count it before you leave .	neutral	3
1588	Yes , that seems to be all in order . Thanks very much .	happiness	4
1589	Quality is very important to us . We work to very low tolerance levels . We need to have guaranteed supplies of consistently high quality raw materials . Over the years we've built up very good relationships with our suppliers .	neutral	1
1590	Do you have many different suppliers ?	neutral	2
1591	Yes . There are about fifty names on our approved supplier list , but for raw materials we tend to deal with three local companies .	neutral	1
1592	Mary , can you tell me how you keep in shape ?	neutral	2
1593	You'll never be in shape until you eat less and take more exercise .	neutral	1
1594	Now , tell me what you often eat .	neutral	3
1595	I often eat fish and eggs .	neutral	4
1596	Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?	neutral	2
1597	Oh yes , and fruits . I love fruits very much .	neutral	1
1598	What do you like to drink ?	neutral	2
1599	Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea .	neutral	1
1600	Whatever would you like to drink ?	neutral	2
1601	I drink a lot of milk . I drink milk almost every day .	neutral	1
1602	How often do you exercise ?	neutral	2
1603	Well , I walk every day .	neutral	1
1604	It's a good diet and a regular exercise .	happiness	1
1605	Yes , quite right .	happiness	1
1606	I am sorry , but I cannot stay for the rest of class today .	neutral	3
1607	Why do you need to leave early ?	neutral	2
1608	I don ’ t feel so good .	neutral	1
1609	What doesn ’ t feel right ?	neutral	2
1610	I feel as if I am going to be sick to my stomach .	neutral	1
1611	Perhaps you should get checked out at the Student Health Center before you go home .	neutral	3
1612	I have some medicine at home that I could take .	neutral	4
1613	Are you going to be OK to drive home , or would you like someone to go with you ?	neutral	3
1614	Thank you , but my friend is in the library , and he can give me a ride home .	neutral	3
1615	We hope that you are feeling better soon . E-mail me if you have any questions .	neutral	3
1616	Your boyfriend is so considerate to you . When do you plan to marry ?	neutral	2
1617	It ’ s still up in the air . There is something wrong between us .	sadness	1
1618	We're considering of ordering 200 computers , but I'm wondering about the price you'll possibly offer .	neutral	2
1619	Our price will be not less than $ 5000 .	neutral	1
1620	Your price is higher than I expected . Could you give us a little discount ?	neutral	3
1621	This is already our best price .	neutral	4
1622	But the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order .	neutral	3
1623	Well , what would you suggest ?	neutral	2
1624	Could you make it $ 4500 ?	neutral	3
1625	I'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price . This is the best price we can quote .	neutral	4
1626	Can we meet each other half way ?	neutral	3
1627	What do you mean ?	neutral	2
1628	Let's close the deal at $ 4800 , OK ?	neutral	3
1629	You drive a hard bargain ! OK , that's a deal .	neutral	4
1630	I'm now on the Songshan airport getting ready for departure . I realized that I might have left my watch .	sadness	3
1631	Yes , Ma'am . May I have your name and room number ?	neutral	2
1632	My name is Terry . I stayed last night in your hotel in room 132 .	neutral	1
1633	What kind of watch is it ?	neutral	2
1634	It's a brand-new Seiko wrist watch .	neutral	1
1635	Yes , we have it .	neutral	1
1636	Oh , I'm glad to hear that . Would you kindly send it to the Hilton Hotel ?	happiness	3
1637	What are your thoughts on the apartment ?	neutral	2
1638	I think that it ’ s absolutely gorgeous .	happiness	1
1639	There aren ’ t any problems with the apartment ?	neutral	2
1640	I think that the apartment looks very nice , but I do see some problems .	neutral	1
1641	What problems ?	neutral	2
1642	I did notice a few stains in the carpet .	neutral	1
1643	We will have the carpet cleaned before you move in .	neutral	1
1644	You will ?	neutral	2
1645	Yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ?	neutral	2
1646	That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment .	neutral	1
1647	I ’ m happy that you find this apartment so appealing .	happiness	1
1648	It is . I love it .	happiness	1
1649	That China-gown of Tang-Dynasty style is so beautiful . Would you show it to me , please ?	neutral	3
1650	Absolutely . Here it is .	neutral	4
1651	Could I try it on ?	neutral	3
1652	Please do , the fitting-room is over there .	neutral	4
1653	It feels a little tight around the waist . Do you have a bigger one ?	neutral	2
1654	I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ?	neutral	3
1655	OK . How much does it cost ?	neutral	2
1656	It's 486 yuan .	neutral	1
1657	Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ?	neutral	2
1658	As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap .	neutral	3
1659	Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling .	neutral	4
1660	So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide .	neutral	1
1661	The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ?	neutral	2
1662	To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken .	neutral	3
1663	That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut .	neutral	4
1664	I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion .	neutral	3
1665	Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ?	neutral	3
1666	Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ?	neutral	3
1667	Good . Friday morning at 9 .	neutral	4
1668	Good morning .	neutral	1
1669	Good morning.This is Mary.Can I speak to Anne please ?	neutral	3
1670	I ’ m sorry She isn ’ t in at the momment.She will come back at half past nineCan I take a message for her ?	sadness	4
1671	Thank you.But I will call her later	happiness	4
1672	OK.Goodbye .	happiness	1
1673	Goodbye .	happiness	1
1674	Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ?	neutral	2
1675	I ’ m all right , thanks . Just a little tired .	neutral	1
1676	Late night ?	neutral	2
1677	Yeah , I got home around two .	neutral	1
1678	We've been waiting here for nearly ten minutes now , and there still isn't a bus in sight .	neutral	1
1679	I'm afraid we'll be late for the party .	neutral	1
1680	Have you got the time , Tom ?	neutral	2
1681	Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch !	anger	1
1682	But you bought it only last month .	neutral	1
1683	Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired .	neutral	1
1684	How long will it take us to get there ?	neutral	2
1685	I think about ten minutes by bus .	neutral	1
1686	It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain .	neutral	3
1687	Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus .	neutral	4
1688	Hi , Mr . Smith . I'm Doctor Hawkins . Why are you here today ?	neutral	2
1689	I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up .	neutral	3
1690	Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year .	neutral	3
1691	I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ?	neutral	1
1692	Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So try to come at least once a year for your own good .	neutral	3
1693	Ok .	neutral	4
1694	Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ?	neutral	2
1695	Yes .	neutral	1
1696	Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit .	neutral	3
1697	I've tried hundreds of times , but I just can't seem to kick the habit .	neutral	4
1698	Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I'll give you more information before you leave .	neutral	3
1699	Ok , thanks doctor .	neutral	4
1700	Good afternoon . Mr . Tylor's office ?	neutral	2
1701	I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension .	neutral	1
1702	I'm sorry , but could you please transfer this call to Mr . Tylor's office ?	neutral	3
1703	Sure , please hold on .	neutral	4
1704	Thank you .	neutral	1
1705	Now Mr . Tylor's on the line . Go ahead , please .	neutral	3
1706	You are so kind , you helped me a lot .	happiness	1
1707	You are welcome . Bye !	happiness	1
1708	Good afternoon , Lexington Software . Angelina Dawson , how can I help ?	neutral	2
1709	Hello , this is Quinn from IBA .	neutral	1
1710	Ah , hello Quinn . Oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , aren't you ?	neutral	2
1711	I'm afraid so , yes .	neutral	1
1712	Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ?	neutral	2
1713	Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake .	neutral	1
1714	What do you recommend we do ?	neutral	2
1715	I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible .	neutral	3
1716	I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now .	neutral	4
1717	Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache .	neutral	1
1718	You should go to the dentist .	neutral	3
1719	I hate dentists .	neutral	4
1720	Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .	neutral	3
1721	It always hurts . I hate going .	neutral	4
1722	Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .	neutral	3
1723	O . K . , O . K . , I ’ ll go .	neutral	4
1724	Good . You'll feel better after you do .	neutral	1
1725	Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please .	neutral	3
1726	Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm .	neutral	4
1727	How long does it take to get there ?	neutral	3
1728	About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive .	neutral	1
1729	Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time !	neutral	2
1730	Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers .	neutral	1
1731	Great ! I ’ ll take it .	happiness	3
1732	Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train !	neutral	3
1733	I understand . Thank you very much !	neutral	4
1734	Have a great trip .	happiness	1
1735	I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend .	neutral	1
1736	A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ?	neutral	2
1737	The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend .	neutral	1
1738	So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ?	neutral	2
1739	It sounds like it will be .	neutral	1
1740	I really hope it doesn't get cold .	neutral	1
1741	That would ruin things , I want to go so badly .	neutral	1
1742	The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know .	neutral	1
1743	That is true . The weather is constantly changing .	neutral	1
1744	It would be nice if the weather would never change .	neutral	1
1745	That would be great , then we could plan things sooner .	neutral	1
1746	True . Predictable weather would make life easier .	neutral	1
1747	Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other .	neutral	1
1748	If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company .	neutral	1
1749	Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating .	neutral	1
1750	But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency .	neutral	1
1751	I doubt that .	neutral	1
1752	Do you eat a lot of healthy food ?	neutral	2
1753	Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind .	neutral	1
1754	You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt .	neutral	1
1755	What's special about these things ?	neutral	2
1756	Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .	neutral	1
1757	Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now .	happiness	1
1758	I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job .	sadness	1
1759	You need to take a break , maybe a vacation .	neutral	3
1760	Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment .	sadness	1
1761	Is that so ?	surprise	2
1762	Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .	neutral	1
1763	Have you decided ?	neutral	2
1764	Yes . I want to get a better job .	neutral	1
1765	Could you tell me why you want to quit ?	neutral	2
1766	I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .	neutral	1
1767	Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?	neutral	2
1768	I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .	neutral	1
1769	OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .	neutral	1
1770	Thank you so much for your advice .	neutral	1
1771	And every best wish for your new job .	neutral	1
1772	Thank you .	neutral	1
1773	The train is leaving . Hurry up ! Which car are we in ?	neutral	2
1774	Let me see . Oh , No . 11 .	neutral	1
1775	Here we are , Car 11 . Let's get in .	neutral	3
1776	Seats No . 20 and 21 . It ’ s nice that we ’ Ve got a window seat .	neutral	1
1777	Let's put our suitcases on the rack .	neutral	3
1778	Oh , the baggage rack is full . Put them under the seat for the time being .	neutral	3
1779	All right .	neutral	4
1780	So , how should we get to the theatre ?	neutral	2
1781	Let's take the bus .	neutral	1
1782	I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .	anger	1
1783	It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .	neutral	1
1784	It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .	anger	1
1785	We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .	neutral	1
1786	Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .	neutral	1
1787	If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?	neutral	3
1788	We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi .	neutral	4
1789	I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .	neutral	3
1790	Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .	neutral	4
1791	It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .	neutral	3
1792	Thanks , that was nice of you .	happiness	4
1793	See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !	neutral	1
1794	Let's go over this plan again .	neutral	3
1795	From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg .	neutral	1
1796	And that is mostly flat , right ?	neutral	2
1797	Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba .	neutral	1
1798	And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ?	neutral	2
1799	That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop .	neutral	1
1800	It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride .	neutral	1
1801	Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ?	neutral	3
1802	Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ?	neutral	2
1803	I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her .	anger	3
1804	I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet .	neutral	4
1805	Anyhow , I'd like to change our room .	neutral	3
1806	No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from .	neutral	3
1807	All right . I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep .	neutral	4
1808	Be sure . I'll make a note of that . Everything will be taken care of . And if there is anything more you need , please let us know .	neutral	1
1809	It's time for bed .	neutral	3
1810	I'm not ready to go to sleep . I'm not tired .	neutral	4
1811	It's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow .	neutral	3
1812	I'm not going to be able to fall asleep .	neutral	4
1813	Why don't you try counting sheep ?	neutral	3
1814	I've tried that before . It really doesn't work .	neutral	4
1815	That's beside the point , you still need to go to bed .	neutral	3
1816	Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ?	neutral	3
1817	If I let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night .	neutral	4
1818	I promise I'll go to sleep soon .	neutral	4
1819	No , you're going to sleep now , so good night .	neutral	3
1820	See you in the morning .	happiness	4
1821	I see myself as being honest , diligent , persevering and creative . And I have a strong sense of responsibility .	neutral	1
1822	How about your psychological resilience ?	neutral	2
1823	I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary .	neutral	1
1824	How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ?	neutral	2
1825	I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way .	neutral	1
1826	You seem to be a kind-hearted lady .	neutral	1
1827	Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature .	neutral	1
1828	Please tell me your weaknesses if you can .	neutral	3
1829	I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection .	neutral	1
1830	Karen ? I need to go over a few things with you .	neutral	3
1831	Certainly . Mr . Graham . When would you like to meet ?	neutral	2
1832	I was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting .	neutral	3

1839	Shame on you !	anger	1
1840	I need some mascara . Do you have good thickening mascara ?	neutral	2
1841	Of course . Here is our thickening mascara . We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes .	neutral	1
1842	Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too . Do you have a color chart can look at ?	neutral	2
1843	We have a very wide selection of colors . And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ?	neutral	1
1844	Oh , sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first .	neutral	1
1845	I can help you with that .	neutral	3
1846	Thank you .	happiness	4
1847	Is this the baggage claim area for flight KB256 ?	neutral	2
1848	Yes , we are on the same plane .	neutral	1
1849	But I am a transfer passenger . I have a connecting flight to Miami .	neutral	1
1850	So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area .	neutral	3
1851	Yes.It ' s quite troublesome .	neutral	4
1852	Why not go and find a porter ?	neutral	3
1853	Billy , you don ’ t look too well . Maybe you should take the day off school .	neutral	3
1854	But Mom ! Today we ’ re playing football ! I love football !	neutral	4
1855	You ’ Ve got a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ’ s that on your arm ?	neutral	2
1856	I don ’ t know . It was there when I woke up this morning .	neutral	1
1857	It ’ s rash . I ’ d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ?	neutral	2
1858	I bashed it against the chair in my room .	neutral	1
1859	Does it hurt ?	neutral	2
1860	A little , but not much .	neutral	1
1861	Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast .	neutral	3
1862	If I ’ m better this afternoon , can I go to school ?	neutral	3
1863	If you are better , but I doubt you will be .	neutral	4
1864	This is your schedule .	neutral	3
1865	You're going out of your way for us , I believe .	happiness	1
1866	You are our honored guests .	happiness	1
1867	Are there any vacancies still available ?	neutral	2
1868	Yes . We need a plumber here .	neutral	1
1869	I am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager .	neutral	3
1870	I am sorry . They are not available now .	neutral	4
1871	My name is Mary , and I will be your waitress tonight .	neutral	1
1872	Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant .	happiness	1
1873	Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ?	neutral	2
1874	Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ?	happiness	2
1875	There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table .	neutral	1
1876	The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ?	neutral	2
1877	You know , that is one of my favorites !	happiness	1
1878	OK , I'll take one order of that .	neutral	3
1879	You could choose another appetizer for half price to share .	neutral	4
1880	Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings .	happiness	3
1881	I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there's something wrong with the fax machine .	sadness	1
1882	What's wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ?	neutral	2
1883	Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ?	neutral	2
1884	Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .	neutral	3
1885	I would like to speak to you , if you don ’ t mind .	neutral	3
1886	What would you like to speak to me about ?	neutral	2
1887	I would like to talk to you about this year ’ s election .	neutral	3
1888	Is that right ?	neutral	2
1889	I am a volunteer for this year ’ s campaign .	neutral	1
1890	That ’ s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand .	neutral	1
1891	I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it .	neutral	1
1892	That ’ s fantastic .	neutral	1
1893	Are you planning on voting ?	neutral	2
1894	I ’ m going to vote .	neutral	1
1895	Go to your polling place early on Election Day .	neutral	3
1896	I will . Good luck with your volunteering .	happiness	4
1897	We hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future .	anger	3
1898	Yes . I promise it will not happen again .	neutral	4
1899	We look forward to your settlement at an early date .	neutral	3
1900	We will inform you as soon as possible .	neutral	4
1901	Hello , Steven . How do you get along with your job ?	neutral	2
1902	Actually , I learn many things from it . I find that I am a quick learner in new things .	neutral	1
1903	Practice makes perfect . By the way , what do you learn from your job ?	neutral	2
1904	At first I didn't know anything about the machine . Now I know how to operate it . Besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement .	neutral	1
1905	Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance .	happiness	1
1906	Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job .	happiness	1
1907	I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work .	neutral	3
1908	OK , let's go .	neutral	4
1909	Where on earth are we ?	neutral	2
1910	Judging by all the traffic , I'd say we're near the outskirts of the city .	neutral	1
1911	What did I do wrong ? Did I take a wrong turn ?	neutral	2
1912	I'm not sure , but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge .	neutral	1
1913	Well , now we should turn back a few kilometres .	neutral	1
1914	It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map .	neutral	1
1915	Hello . Front desk .	neutral	1
1916	Yes . This is Bob Robinson . I ’ m calling from room number 627 .	neutral	1
1917	Hi , Bob . What can I do for you ?	neutral	2
1918	Is it possible to change to another room ?	neutral	3
1919	Could you please tell me why ?	neutral	3
1920	My room is facing the swimming pool . It ’ s noisy for me . I have a problem sleeping . And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator .	neutral	1
1921	So you need a quiet side room on the lower floor .	neutral	3
1922	You ’ re right .	neutral	4
1923	Okay . Let me check for a room on the first floor .	neutral	3
1924	Thank you .	neutral	4
1925	I ’ Ve only two rooms on the first floor . How about room 108 ?	neutral	3
1926	That ’ s fine . Can I move now ?	neutral	3
1927	Sure . I ’ ll send the bellman to help you .	neutral	4
1928	Oh , thank you kindly .	happiness	1
1929	You ’ re welcome .	happiness	1
1930	How long will it take for our order to be delivered ?	neutral	2
1931	Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles .	neutral	1
1932	Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control .	neutral	2
1933	No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go .	neutral	1
1934	Now you're my boss , Mr . Henry .	neutral	1
1935	Do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?	neutral	2
1936	No , nothing in particular .	neutral	1
1937	You may ask questions about us , if you have any .	neutral	3
1938	All right . When can I start ?	neutral	2
1939	What are you doing here today ?	neutral	2
1940	I would like to fight my ticket .	neutral	3
1941	Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today ?	neutral	2
1942	Yes , the officer is here today .	neutral	1
1943	What's your case ?	neutral	2
1944	I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did .	neutral	1
1945	Do you believe that the officer lied ?	neutral	2
1946	There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying .	neutral	1
1947	Your license plate was caught on camera ?	neutral	2
1948	A picture of my license plate was never taken .	neutral	1
1949	Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go .	neutral	3
1950	Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me .	happiness	4
1951	Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ?	neutral	2
1952	Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long .	neutral	1
1953	Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices .	neutral	2
1954	That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options .	neutral	1
1955	What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ?	neutral	2
1956	Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into .	neutral	1
1957	So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?	neutral	2
1958	Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .	neutral	1
1959	Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will .	neutral	1
1960	After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice .	neutral	1
1961	what shall we do after the volleyball match ?	neutral	2
1962	how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym .	neutral	3
1963	that's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .	happiness	4
1964	me , too . What did you have in mind ?	neutral	2
1965	I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must .	neutral	1
1966	"I agree . They're very lovely , especially "" Huan Huan "" ."	happiness	1
1967	is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ?	neutral	2
1968	the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive .	neutral	1
1969	oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ?	neutral	2
1970	I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now .	neutral	1
1971	any other ideas ?	neutral	2
1972	there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts .	neutral	1
1973	it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have .	happiness	3
1974	Mom ! I hate eating vegetables !	anger	1
1975	You don ’ t have to eat them . I don ’ t mind .	neutral	1
1976	Thanks mom ! Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake !	neutral	3
1977	No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables .	neutral	4
1978	But I don ’ t like them ! It ’ s not fair !	anger	1
1979	You can have some fruit for dessert . If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake .	neutral	1
1980	Ok ... actually , I don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots , buy I hate broccoli and cauliflower .	neutral	1
1981	I ’ ll remember that for next time . You ’ ll get extra peas and carrots , buy no broccoli or cauliflower . OK ?	neutral	2
1982	Thanks mom !	happiness	1
1983	It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . It gave me a good idea of your product range .	neutral	1
1984	It ’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . What ’ s your general impression , may I ask ?	neutral	2
1985	Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model .	neutral	1
1986	That ’ s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago .	neutral	1
1987	The machine gives you an edge over your competitors , I guess .	neutral	1
1988	Certainly . No one can match us as far as speed is concerned .	neutral	1
1989	Could you give me some brochures for that machine ? And the price if possible .	neutral	3
1990	Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature .	neutral	4
1991	Thank you . I think we may be able to work together in the future .	happiness	1
1992	Is the factory fully-automated ?	neutral	2
1993	Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually .	neutral	1
1994	What about supply of parts to the production line ?	neutral	2
1995	Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line .	neutral	1
1996	What about the smaller components ?	neutral	2
1997	They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory .	neutral	1
1998	I'm glad you're on your ten-year reunion planning committee .	happiness	1
1999	Yeah , you get the TV to yourself while I spend my nights surfing the Net for missing classmates .	neutral	1
2000	That's not why . This way I can see how you guys do this sort of thing .	neutral	1
2001	I guess . Don't you have reunions in Taiwan ?	neutral	2
2002	Definitely . Every year . But just for our forty-person class .	neutral	1
2003	Ours are for everyone that graduated in the same year .	neutral	1
2004	What does your job involve ?	neutral	2
2005	I'm the Project Manager so I have to make sure our projects run smoothly . I work with three Project Engineers . They take care of after-sales service and look after the maintenance side of the business .	neutral	1
2006	How many languages can you speak ?	neutral	2
2007	Besides Chinese , I can speak English and French .	neutral	1
2008	You mean you can read and write both of them ?	neutral	2
2009	No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French .	neutral	1
2010	Can you read and write English well ?	neutral	2
2011	I can speak the language better than read and write .	neutral	1
2012	Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries ?	neutral	2
2013	I think so . I used to be an interpreter .	neutral	1
2014	Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work ?	neutral	2
2015	The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm .	neutral	1
2016	What can I get for you ? Here is the menu .	neutral	2
2017	Let me have a look . Well , how many kinds of steaks do you have ?	neutral	2
2018	We have sirloin steaks , pepper steak , and filet steak .	neutral	1
2019	Is there something go with the filet steak ?	neutral	2
2020	Yes , we have various sauces . What about the gravy ?	neutral	3
2021	Are you ready to go shopping ?	neutral	2
2022	Just a minute . I need to make a list of thinks that we need .	neutral	3
2023	Good idea . Have you written down potatoes , carrots , and onions ?	neutral	2
2024	I don ’ t have onions on my list . I ’ ll add them . We should get some tea . Is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get ?	neutral	2
2025	Let ’ s get both . We need some coffee too . Is that on your list ?	neutral	2
2026	Yes , it is . Here ’ s my list . Is there anything that I ’ Ve forgotten ?	neutral	2
2027	I think you ’ Ve got everything . I want to got some chocolate and some cheese .	neutral	1
2028	What kind of cheese do you want .	neutral	2
2029	I ’ m not sure . I ’ ll decide at the cheese counter , when I can see what they have . Have we got enough money ?	neutral	2
2030	We don ’ t have enough cash , so I ’ ll take my credit card and we can pay with that . Where are the car keys ?	neutral	2
2031	I ’ Ve got them there . Shall I drive ?	neutral	3
2032	Hello , can you tell me how to use the telephone ?	neutral	3
2033	If you want to order meals , call 8801.If you need other help , call 8803 and someone will be there .	neutral	1
2034	Thank you so much . By the way , is there a mail service ?	neutral	2
2035	Yes , you can take your letters to the counter over there .	neutral	1
2036	Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . A technician has just come and checked it . He will bring me a new one tomorrow . It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . Can I use the one in your office ?	neutral	3
2037	Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ?	neutral	2
2038	Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?	neutral	2
2039	Yes , it will print immediately .	neutral	1
2040	How many years have you done business with China ?	neutral	2
2041	Let me see , about five years , we established our business relationship with Hua Mei of China Import & Export Corporation in 2003 .	neutral	1
2042	Do you have any difficulties in doing business in China ? You know the Chinese economic legislation is still incomplete ?	neutral	2
2043	I don't think I have any problem with our Chinese partners . They have always followed the contract strictly . We can do business directly with the corporation . As I mentioned before , the Chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law . Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies .	neutral	1
2044	Well , it's known that the Sino-American relation is in a dilemma . Does it influence your business in China ?	neutral	2
2045	Actually not at present . But we are afraid it will . You know policies influence business to some extent . I hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists . China is really a large market . We don't want to lose it .	neutral	1
2046	Thank you .	neutral	1
2047	You're welcome .	neutral	1
2048	Give me a pack of first-class stamps , please .	neutral	3
2049	Here you are . That will be five dollars . Anything else ?	neutral	2
2050	Yes . I want some post cards and some airmail stamps . I want to send some letters to South America .	neutral	1
2051	Just a moment , I'll look up the rate for air-mail letters to South America .	neutral	4
2052	Can you tell me how much it will cost to send a package to Colombia ? Also , I what to know how long it will take .	neutral	3
2053	Do you have the package with you ? I would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost .	neutral	2
2054	Do you insure package ?	neutral	2
2055	Yes . All you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for .	neutral	1
2056	Is there a way that I can be sure that the people in South america receive my package ?	neutral	2
2057	The post office rarely loses package . You can , however , request a rectum receipt .	neutral	1
2058	One last question-what are your hours ?	neutral	2
2059	We open at eight-thirty in the morning and close at five-thirty in the afternoon .	neutral	1
2060	Thank you , you helped me a lot .	happiness	1
2061	Hello , thank you for taking the time to interview me .	neutral	1
2062	Hi there , I ’ m Bill Gotcha , the owner of Gotcha Enterprises . Did you find your way here OK ?	neutral	2
2063	Your assistant gave wonderful directions .	neutral	1
2064	Why are you switching jobs at this point in your career ?	neutral	2
2065	Our Company is moving overseas and I wish to stay in the United States .	neutral	1
2066	What are you best at ?	neutral	2
2067	I am good at organizing systems that have been having problems .	neutral	1
2068	What is your biggest challenge in terms of skills ?	neutral	2
2069	I don ’ t like to sit around and so like to always find things to do to keep myself busy .	neutral	1
2070	That is good to hear !	happiness	1
2071	Good morning . SRC international . How may I help you ?	neutral	3
2072	Good morning . I'd like to speak to Peter . Chen Please .	neutral	3
2073	Certainly . Who should I say is calling ?	neutral	2
2074	This is Tim . Hunter from Hunter industries .	neutral	1
2075	And what is it regarding please ?	neutral	3
2076	We have an appointment for this afternoon . Mr . Chen will know why I'm calling .	neutral	3
2077	Of course , Please hold the line Mr . Hunter .	neutral	4
2078	Right , let me run through your options . You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to , but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan .	neutral	3
2079	OK , what does that entail ?	neutral	2
2080	It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances .	neutral	3
2081	Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ?	neutral	2
2082	Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate .	neutral	1
2083	I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ?	happiness	1
2084	Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu .	neutral	3
2085	Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today .	happiness	4
2086	My aunt told me one of her secrets--cellophane tape .	neutral	1
2087	I just got it at the special health store . It's for my flabby arms .	neutral	1
2088	Let me know how it works .	neutral	1
2089	I have to say , I have had enough of this roller coaster .	neutral	1
2090	I know what you mean . I'm like a yo-yo .	neutral	1
2091	Last week I was down to 60 kilos . This week I had one donut more . Now I'm up to 62 kilos .	neutral	1
2092	May I have a menu , please ?	neutral	3
2093	Of course .	neutral	4
2094	Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ?	neutral	3
2095	Lobster ? It is steamed and served with our special sauce .	neutral	4
2096	Is it good ?	neutral	2
2097	Sure . It is a most popular dish .	neutral	1
2098	I think I will try some lobster , and give me some green salad together .	neutral	3
2099	Can ’ t you come in and have tea now , Peter ?	neutral	3
2100	Not yet , I must water the garden first .	neutral	4
2101	Do you have to water it now ?	neutral	2
2102	I ’ m afraid I must . Look at it ! It ’ s terribly dry .	neutral	1
2103	What a nuisance !	disgust	1
2104	Last summer it was very dry , too . Don ’ t you remember ? I had to water it every day .	neutral	1
2105	Well , I ’ ll have tea by myself . That was quick ! Have you finished already ?	neutral	2
2106	Yes , Look out of the window .	neutral	1
2107	It ’ s raining . That means you needn ’ t water the garden .	neutral	3
2108	That was a pleasant surprise . It means I can have tea , instead .	happiness	4
2109	I'm broke , and I have to catch another bus .	neutral	1
2110	Why don't you have any money for another bus ?	neutral	2
2111	I got hungry and bought some chips .	neutral	1
2112	That was smart .	neutral	1
2113	Anyway , do you have any change I can use for the bus ?	neutral	3
2114	I don't have any .	neutral	4
2115	I don't know how I'm going to get home .	neutral	1
2116	Get a transfer from the bus driver .	neutral	3
2117	How much is a transfer ?	neutral	2
2118	It doesn't cost anything .	neutral	1
2119	That's great ! Thanks for your help .	happiness	4
2120	You know what ? Don't mention it .	neutral	1
2121	Hello , Anna . Come in and sit down .	neutral	1
2122	Hello , doctor .	neutral	1
2123	What's the matter ?	neutral	2
2124	I've got a backache .	neutral	1
2125	Do you often suffer from backache ?	neutral	2

2227	Hello . I'm not sure who I need to speak to . I got this 50 yuan note today and it seems a little odd to me .	neutral	1
2228	The first thing we do is check the feel of the paper ;d oes it feel too thick or too thin ? Then we check the watermark . In my opinion it is counterfeit . I'll just run it through the scanner to double check .	neutral	3
2229	What happens now ?	neutral	2
2230	Well , it's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . So , unfortunately you'll lose this 50 RIB . We'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .	neutral	3

2236	No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago.It must be other problems .	neutral	1
2237	Well , I suppose it could be the gas .	neutral	1
2238	No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday .	neutral	1
2239	Perhaps it's the starter then ?	neutral	2
2240	Yes , that's possible .	neutral	1

2242	I'm reading a novel , The mill on the floss , written by the famous novelist gorge alias .	neutral	1

2247	Besides novels , any other types literary works that you indulgence .	neutral	2
2248	I really like short stories .	neutral	1
2249	Have you read anything else besides literature ?	neutral	2
2250	Certainly I have . I like to read books on vary subjects , and i can read everything I can get my hands on in my spare time . I don't want to idle away and waste my time .	neutral	1
2251	I agree . People who don't read are no better often people who can't read . I also agree that books are like food for the mind .	neutral	1
2252	We have three dressings for salad . Which one would you like ?	neutral	2
2253	What kind do you have ?	neutral	2
2254	We have Italian , French and Thousand Island .	neutral	1

2256	I saw a vacancy board outside for assistant . Has the vacancy been filled ?	neutral	2
2257	Not yet . But do you have any experience as an assistant ?	neutral	2

2267	Very good . I ’ ll take it .	happiness	1
2268	Hmm . Let me try something.Wait . I have a reservation for someone named Sang here . But it's spelled J - A - N - G . It's not spelled J - I - A - N - G . It's for a Mr . C Sang .	neutral	1
2269	Oh , that must be me ! Probably they typed the name wrong.My husband's English isn't so good .	neutral	1
2270	Yes , sometimes it happens , Ma'am . That's why it is always good to carry your confirmation number . I'm sorry about the inconvenience .	neutral	3
2271	It's okay . It's probably my husband's fault.Is there a pool in this hotel ?	neutral	2
2272	Yes , of course.The pool is open until 10:00 p . m . So you still have about 45 minutes .	neutral	1
2273	Good .	neutral	1
2274	Here is your key . Your room is 379.You can find the elevators just around that corner there , down the hall.Enjoy your stay , Ma'am .	neutral	1
2275	Thank you .	neutral	1
2276	Excuse me , I need to get to Cambridge today .	neutral	3
2277	Would you like to go by train or by bus ?	neutral	3
2278	I am not sure , which one is better ?	neutral	2
2279	The bus is cheaper but also slower . It will take about two-and-a-half hours .	neutral	1
2280	And how long does the train take ?	neutral	2
2281	If you take the fast train , it will take about 50 minutes .	neutral	1
2282	Where do I catch the train ?	neutral	2
2283	The trains for Cambridge leave from King's Cross Station . They run approximately every half hour . Most trains to Cambridge go from Platform 9 .	neutral	1
2284	How do I get to King's Cross ?	neutral	2
2285	The best way is to take an underground tube train directly to King's Cross . The Underground station is just round the corner from here .	neutral	1
2286	Can you show me on the map ?	neutral	3
2287	It is very easy . Just turn right when you leave and then turn right again at the first crossroads . The entrance to the Underground station is about 50 meters further on .	neutral	4
2288	Thank you very much .	happiness	1
2289	You're welcome .	happiness	1
2290	Have you seen the sales report for last quarter ? Who do you think is our digest threat ?	neutral	2
2291	From the numbers , it seems like Forest Inc . is our digest competitor ... Le'Ban and Markford are also major contenders in our market .	neutral	1
2292	Le'Ban is the new kid on the block , it's amazing they've had such tremendous success so soon ... With them on the scene , the competition is outthrough .	neutral	1
2293	here's information about our competitor's recent market activities ...	neutral	1
2294	Thanks , this will be a big help in putting together next quarter's marketing strategies . With competition this intense , we'll have to step up production even more . We need a price we can compete with .	neutral	1
2295	We're in a very competitive environment . It's sink or saimin this market .	neutral	1
2296	Better start swimming ! we've got to find a way to outsmart the other guys . I want a preliminarily strategic marketing plan on my desk by next Tuesday ... the competition never sleeps and neither should we .	neutral	3

2300	I want a single room with ocean view . Do you have one ?	neutral	3

2302	OK . I will take it .	neutral	3
2303	When do you check in ? How long are you planning to stay ? Do you have any special requirements ?	neutral	2
2304	I guess I am going to arrive at 9:00 in the morning and I would like to leave at 200 in the afternoon on Sunday . Please give me a room away from the elevator . I hate noises while I am sleeping .	neutral	3
2305	OK . No problem .	neutral	4
2306	We need to call an emergency meeting as soon as possible about this .	neutral	3
2307	OK . Let me send a memo around .	neutral	4
2308	Schedule it for this afternoon , when Ken gets back .	neutral	3
2309	I don ’ t think he ’ s back today .	neutral	1
2310	Oh , that ’ s right . Go ahead anyways . I ’ ll fill him in . We can ’ t lose this order under any circumstances !	neutral	3

2315	I have a little problem , I'm overweight for my height . I think I should go on a diet .	neutral	1
2316	The consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us . We have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality I am afraid .	neutral	3
2317	Is there anything wrong ?	neutral	2
2318	We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard .	neutral	1
2319	It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ?	surprise	2
2320	Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally	neutral	1
2321	Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We ’ ll send our technicians to repair them .	neutral	3
2322	Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee .	neutral	3
2323	I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee .	neutral	3
2324	All right . In that case we are still willing to do business with you .	neutral	4
2325	Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday .	neutral	1
2326	Oh where was that ?	neutral	2
2327	I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track .	neutral	1
2328	Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . She is always making us kids eat the proper foods .	neutral	1
2329	Well , it pays off for her . How old is she anyway ?	neutral	2
2330	She will be 86 next month .	neutral	1
2331	That is truly amazing !	happiness	1
2332	Did you punch in ?	neutral	2
2333	Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable !	happiness	1
2334	Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it .	surprise	1
2335	Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ?	neutral	2
2336	Sure , when those never ending meetings .	neutral	1
2337	I don't think you've met my sister , Mary .	neutral	1
2338	No , I haven't had the pleasure .	neutral	1
2339	Come and meet her now .	neutral	3
2340	All right .	neutral	4
2341	Excuse me , would you tell me how to return to Hilton Hotel . I'm afraid I lost my way .	sadness	3
2342	Did you have hotel card or something ?	neutral	2
2343	Let me see . Yes , I have the address and hotel telephone number here .	neutral	1
2344	Oh , you stay at the down town Hilton . When you go down two blocks this way and turn left , you will find it on your right .	neutral	3
2345	I don't understand very well . Could you give me a map ?	neutral	3
2346	The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ?	happiness	2
2347	I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself .	neutral	1
2348	So , let ’ s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ’ t they ?	neutral	2
2349	Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced .	neutral	1
2350	How long did it take you to do the tiling .	neutral	2
2351	As I hadn ’ t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether .	neutral	1
2352	I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?	happiness	3
2353	You ’ ll be lucky ! However , I ’ ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself .	happiness	4
2354	I'd like to see that pen , please .	neutral	3
2355	You mean this one ?	neutral	2
2356	No , the other one in the brown case .	neutral	1
2357	Oh , this one ... Here .	neutral	1
2358	May I try it ?	neutral	3
2359	Sure .	neutral	4
2360	It's very smooth . I'll take it .	neutral	1
2361	Cash or charge ?	neutral	2
2362	Charge , please .	neutral	1
2363	I ’ Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles .	neutral	3
2364	We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days .	neutral	3
2365	Why , your price has soared . It ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price .	neutral	4
2366	I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere .	neutral	3
2367	I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources .	neutral	4
2368	But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries .	neutral	3
2369	I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years .	neutral	4
2370	There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price .	neutral	3
2371	Well , we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ’ ll have to try , I suppose .	neutral	4
2372	Good morning.sir.My name is Liu Peng from Tsinghai University . I am here for the interview relating to my visa application .	neutral	1
2373	Glad to meet you.Would you mind if I ask you some questions ?	neutral	3
2374	Of course not .	neutral	4
2375	Why do you want to go to the US ?	neutral	2
2376	I'd like to have further education.Now I am studying for my doctorate .	neutral	1
2377	Will you get any kind of scholarship ?	neutral	2
2378	Yes . The school has provided me with full scholarship and that will be enough to support myself .	neutral	1
2379	Could you say something about your educational background ?	neutral	3
2380	Yes . I graduated from shanghai University and later obtained a master's degree from Oxford .	neutral	1
2381	What was your graduation thesis on ?	neutral	2

2393	Here you are , a thousand Yuan and my ID .	neutral	4

2398	So , what experience do you have ?	neutral	2
2399	I have ten years marketing experience . This includes both entry level and management positions . In my last position , I worked my way up to being director of the marking department .	neutral	1
2400	I can see that from your resume.Your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? Later , why did you decide to leave your former post ?	neutral	2
2401	I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new .	neutral	1
2402	I see . Do you want to work full-time or part-time ?	neutral	2
2403	I would rather work full-time .	neutral	1
2404	I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ?	neutral	2
2405	I am willing to negotiate , but I expect at least $ 40,000 a year .	neutral	1

2407	I feel sorry for you . It's a jungle out there .	neutral	4
2408	Do you know any places ?	neutral	2
2409	Well . I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available .	neutral	1
2410	Thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet .	happiness	1
2411	How much do are you looking to spend ?	neutral	2

2807	I'm going to clean it up later .	neutral	1
2808	Didn't I ask you to clean it up earlier ?	neutral	2
2809	I'm going to clean it .	neutral	1
2810	I want you to vacuum in your room , and don't forget to dust everything .	neutral	3

2820	Just one thing before you go , could you please prepare your documents in accordance with the L / C within the validity period ?	neutral	3
2821	No problem , I'll get on that right away . Thanks , bye .	neutral	4
2822	Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ?	neutral	3
2823	What do you need ?	neutral	2
2824	I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him .	neutral	3
2825	He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves .	neutral	4
2826	I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable !	anger	1
2827	Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .	neutral	3
2828	He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .	anger	1
2829	I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .	neutral	3
2830	I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me .	anger	1
2831	Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss .	neutral	3
2832	Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .	anger	1
2833	Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper .	neutral	3
2834	I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?	disgust	4
2835	I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions .	neutral	3
2836	hey , you look great ! how's everything ?	neutral	2
2837	yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit .	neutral	1
2838	really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work .	neutral	2
2839	it's important to do proper exercises .	neutral	1
2840	you're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .	neutral	1
2841	the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .	neutral	3
2842	sounds reasonable .	neutral	4
2843	we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .	neutral	3
2844	and fruits !	neutral	3
2845	surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .	neutral	3
2846	I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?	neutral	2
2847	yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can help one to keep sound physical health .	neutral	1
2848	I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .	neutral	1
2849	you bet it !	neutral	1
2850	Staying out all night , you frightened me to death .	anger	1
2851	I stayed with my friends .	neutral	1
2852	You should at least give me a call .	anger	3
2853	I'm sorry , Mum .	sadness	4
2854	Did anyone call ?	neutral	2
2855	Just Mr . White .	neutral	1
2856	What did he want ?	neutral	2
2857	He wouldn't say over the phone .	neutral	1
2858	What kind of job do you intend to do ?	neutral	2
2859	I want to do some management job since I have three-year's work history .	neutral	1
2860	What are your plans if you were hired ?	neutral	2
2861	I would apply my specialty and experience to my job and gradually move up to the management level in this company .	neutral	1
2862	You stepped on my foot !	neutral	1
2863	Sorry . I didn't mean to .	sadness	1
2864	what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ?	neutral	2
2865	while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement .	neutral	1
2866	why not ?	neutral	2
2867	the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing !	neutral	1
2868	it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking .	neutral	1
2869	I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children .	neutral	1
2870	I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking .	neutral	1
2871	all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty .	neutral	1
2872	perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow .	neutral	1
2873	I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them .	neutral	1
2874	that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad .	neutral	1
2875	you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking .	neutral	1
2876	Good morning . Could I speak with Mr . Willard please ?	neutral	3
2877	This is he . Who ’ s calling , please ?	neutral	2
2878	This is Chris Emerson speaking .	neutral	1
2879	Hello , Chris . How can I help you ?	neutral	2
2880	Can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum , Miss Thong ?	neutral	3
2881	Certainly . A letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted . A memorandum is a communication within an organization .	neutral	1
2882	Should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum ?	neutral	2
2883	No , not necessary . Usually we have a set form which is printed . We just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company .	neutral	3
2884	Of course , let me find one for you .	neutral	3
2885	Hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ?	neutral	2
2886	Sorry , it ’ s all sold out .	sadness	1
2887	Well , do you have any for tomorrow ?	neutral	2
2888	We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m .	neutral	1
2889	Ok . I ’ ll take it .	neutral	3
2890	Where would you like to sit ?	neutral	2
2891	Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes .	neutral	2
2892	Certainly .	happiness	1
2893	Lily , I am terribly sorry about this . But we have to put off or cancel tomorrow's meeting .	neutral	3
2894	Cancelled ? That's just can't happen !	surprise	4
2895	Sorry to say , but nothing can be done . The equipment broke down and can't be fixed till Friday .	neutral	3
2896	Oh , I hope it be fixed on Friday .	neutral	3
2897	Overseas operator , may I help you ?	neutral	2
2898	Yes . I would like to place a collect call .	neutral	3
2899	Can you tell me the name and number of the person you want ?	neutral	3
2900	Terry and his number is 4562325 8 .	neutral	4
2901	Please wait a moment . It Will take a few seconds to get through .	neutral	4
2902	Would you help me figure out what to do about the office party ?	neutral	3
2903	I would be happy to help . What would you like me to help with , food or entertainment ?	neutral	2
2904	I would like to help you with both .	neutral	3
2905	That will work out fine . To make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ?	neutral	2
2906	A dressy party would be fun !	neutral	3
2907	That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ?	neutral	2
2908	We should probably have both .	neutral	3
2909	Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ?	neutral	2
2910	Maybe we could do both !	neutral	3
2911	Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details .	happiness	4
2912	I can't find the price tag .	neutral	1
2913	It's right here . $ 100 .	neutral	1
2914	But I heard other stores were having great mark-downs on this item .	neutral	1
2915	Ours are of really good quality .	neutral	1
2916	I see , please wrap it .	neutral	3
2917	Peter , how often do you exercise ?	neutral	2
2918	Well , I swim and run every day .	neutral	1
2919	Now , tell me , what do you eat ?	neutral	2
2920	Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .	neutral	1
2921	Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?	neutral	2
2922	Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .	neutral	1
2923	What do you drink ?	neutral	2
2924	Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .	neutral	1
2925	What do you drink ?	neutral	2
2926	Where can I call a taxi ?	neutral	2
2927	There's a taxi rank over there , right outside the gate .	neutral	1
2928	How did your company's fundraiser go ?	neutral	2
2929	The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research .	neutral	1
2930	So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ?	neutral	2
2931	Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars .	neutral	1
2932	Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society .	neutral	1
2933	In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause .	neutral	1
2934	How may I help you today ?	neutral	2
2935	I need to open a second account .	neutral	3
2936	What kind of account would you like to open ?	neutral	2
2937	I need another savings account .	neutral	3
2938	Do you have another account with us ?	neutral	2
2939	I sure do .	neutral	1
2940	Would you like to transfer money from that account into your new one ?	neutral	3
2941	That ’ s fine .	neutral	4
2942	How much would you like to transfer ?	neutral	2
2943	Transfer $ 100 .	neutral	1
2944	Give me a moment while I complete your transaction .	neutral	3
2945	That ’ s fine . Thank you .	neutral	4
2946	How about your grades of study ?	neutral	2
2947	I have been doing quite well . As reach 90 % and Bs reach 100 % . And I ’ Ve received Scholarship two times .	neutral	1
2948	Besides your major , do you know some in other fields ?	neutral	2
2949	Yes . To develop my knowledge , I studied Economics , Business Administration and Accountingthrough self-study . Nowadays , I have passed three courses on CPA .	neutral	1
2950	Have you ever been a student cadre ?	neutral	2
2951	Yes . I used to be the monitor of my class .	neutral	1
2952	Did it affect you much ?	neutral	2
2953	It ’ s a very important experience for me . First , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . Second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike .	neutral	1
2954	In your spare time , do you have any part time jobs ?	neutral	2
2955	Yes , I used to work as an assistant lawyer for Tienda Law Office .	neutral	1
2956	What kind of a car do you have ?	neutral	2
2957	An old one .	neutral	1
2958	I know it's old , but what make is it ?	neutral	2
2959	It's a Chevrolet . Why do you ask ? You going into the car business ?	surprise	2
2960	Nothing like that . My cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him , so he's going to sell it - cheap . It's practically new .	neutral	1
2961	well I have been thinking about getting a newer car . I can't afford a brand new one .	neutral	1
2962	Would you like to look at my cousin's car ?	neutral	3
2963	Is it a four-door or a two-door ?	neutral	2
2964	It's a coupe with a vinyl roof .	neutral	1
2965	Does it have automatic transmission ? .	neutral	2
2966	Yes , and it also has power steering , power brakes , and air conditioning .	neutral	1
2967	I guess I might take a look at it .	neutral	4
2968	What is my prime responsibility in daily work ?	neutral	2
2969	Your main job is serving the clients and giving them what they want .	neutral	1
2970	What other things do I need to know ?	neutral	2
2971	You'd spend 30 % of your time on the computer . You may be bored with a job like that .	neutral	1
2972	No problem . I am used to it .	neutral	1
2973	Good afternoon . May I help you ?	neutral	2

2979	Here you are . Ms . Stevens is ready for you now . I ’ ll show you to her office , right this way .	neutral	3
2980	How about your interview ?	neutral	2
2981	They turned me down .	sadness	1
2982	Why ? You are so excellent .	surprise	2
2983	I think the only reason is that I was too nervous during the interview and I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to .	sadness	1
2984	What a shame ! You should have showed yourself to them !	sadness	1
2985	It doesn't matter . I'll try other companies .	neutral	1
2986	I suggest you hunt for a job on the Internet .	neutral	3
2987	On the Internet ? I've never heard of it .	neutral	2
2988	It's very convenient and it has become popular recently .	neutral	3
2989	Is that safe ?	neutral	2
2990	Of course , if you log on some standard websites .	neutral	3
2991	Thank you for your advice . I'll have a try .	neutral	4

3009	Really ? It is amazing . I will apply for a position in your company .	surprise	4
3010	Ahem ... uh , sir , I beg your pardon ... Uh , mister , are you waiting to buy a ticket for the movie ?	neutral	2

3049	I ’ ll take them .	neutral	1

3079	Sure . Why don ’ t you try it on ? The fitting room is over there .	happiness	3
3080	It ’ s just the right size-a perfect fit ! Have you seen anything you like ?	happiness	2
3081	I ’ m thinking about buying this sweater . I know it ’ s June now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .	neutral	1
3082	It looks too big for you , but I like the color and the material is good quality . Is it on sale ?	neutral	2
3083	Yes , it ’ s half price . It ’ s supposed to be too large--that ’ s the fashion .	neutral	1
3084	I might get one too , but in a different color . I prefer light blue to white 。	neutral	1
3085	There.It looks great , don ’ t you think ? I ’ m going to get these jeans as well . I need a new pair . I ‘ m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter .	happiness	2

3092	That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy . Will he be back soon ?	sadness	2
3093	I'm afraid not . He's gone for the rest of the day .	neutral	1
3094	Is there anywhere I can reach him ?	neutral	2
3095	I don't believe so . He's going out of town on business . May I take a message ?	neutral	3
3096	I have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but I'm afraid I can't make it .	neutral	1
3097	Would you care to make another appointment ?	neutral	3
3098	Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days .	neutral	4
3099	I see . I can tell Mr.Thomas that you phoned .	neutral	3
3100	Thank you .	neutral	1
3101	Bye-bye .	neutral	1
3102	I see you have bought the latest copy of “ beauty and fashion ” . Are there any interesting articles in it ?	neutral	2
3103	There ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The “ which ? ” section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . The article recommends “ all clear ” for effectiveness and price .	neutral	1
3104	I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine .	neutral	1
3105	Which tests do you mean ?	neutral	2
3106	You know . Tests like ” how jealous are you ? ” and “ are you a fashion victim ? ”	neutral	1
3107	Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ’ t take them seriously .	neutral	1
3108	Of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . According to the jealousy test , I ’ m quite a jealous type of person . Perhaps I need to control my jealousy .	neutral	1

3115	You ’ d better , to protect your clothes . Now please watch your step .	neutral	3
3116	Thank you . Is the production line fully automated ?	neutral	2
3117	Well , not fully automated .	neutral	1
3118	I see . How do you control the quality ?	neutral	2
3119	All products have to go through five checks in the whole manufacturing process .	neutral	1
3120	What ’ s the monthly output ?	neutral	2
3121	One thousand units per month now . But we ’ ll be making 1,200 units beginning with October .	neutral	1
3122	What ’ s your usual percentage of rejects ?	neutral	2
3123	About 2 % in normal operations .	neutral	1

3135	Yes , I ’ m pretty sure .	neutral	1
3136	Do you have her address ?	neutral	2
3137	Yes , I do . It ’ s 109 Locks Ave , L8V 4N9 .	neutral	1
3138	That ’ s an unlisted number . I ’ m sorry , but I can ’ t give it to you .	neutral	1
3139	I see . Thanks anyway .	happiness	1
3140	No problem .	happiness	1
3141	I ’ d like to open a savings account . Can you tell me how to do it ?	neutral	3
3142	Ok , you have to fill out the form . And I let me see three identification cards or documents .	neutral	2
3143	I have the driver ’ s license , a membership card and my passport . Would we do ?	neutral	3
3144	Let me see them . Yes . There ’ re ok .	neutral	4
3145	What ‘ s the minimum amount I can deposit in an account ?	neutral	2
3146	You can deposit and ensure amount of ten dollars .	neutral	3
3147	Thank you .	happiness	1
3148	We are willing to participate in the bid which you advertised in China Daily . Would you please tell me the detail of the tender conditions ?	neutral	3
3149	You will receive the tender notice next month and you'll find the information .	neutral	3
3150	OK ! Our company is very interested in the tender . I am sure that we will do our best to win the bidding in building the factory .	neutral	4
3151	I believe your corporation will try your best and I understand fully your feeling , if your tender conditions proved be suitable for our general conditions of tender , we will accept your submission of tender .	neutral	1
3152	Maybe I have asking too many questions today .	neutral	1

3154	Fine , thanks a lot . Bye !	happiness	4
3155	Bye !	neutral	1
3156	Good morning , Mr Zhang , I wonder whether you have got an answer from your superior .	neutral	2
3157	Yes , we had a meting about it yesterday afternoon .	neutral	1
3158	What's the answer ?	neutral	2
3159	We decided that we could agree to your price , but we are a bit worried about the slow delivery .	neutral	1
3160	Let me see . I quoted your delivery in three months , didn't I ?	neutral	2
3161	Yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible .	neutral	3
3162	I thought you would be worried about it . So I rang Auckland last night . As you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave Auckland next month .	neutral	1
3163	Good , if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then .	neutral	3
3164	By all means .	neutral	4
3165	Be careful . The floor is wet .	neutral	3
3166	What happened ?	neutral	2
3167	I spilled my drink .	neutral	1
3168	Hello , this is Lucie Jing calling from Lincoln Bank . May I speak to Mr Was , please ?	neutral	3
3169	Speaking .	neutral	4
3170	Ah , hello , Mr Was . I'm just calling about your new credit card . It has arrived with us , so you can either come to collect it , or we can send it on to you .	neutral	3
3171	Sending it won't be necessary . I'm actually coming in for a meeting with my Personal Banker this afternoon .	neutral	4
3172	What perfect timing !	happiness	1
3173	Indeed . Is there anything I need to do before I collect it ?	neutral	2
3174	Not really . But we do recommend you to read through our terms and conditions again before you sign the card , just in case there is something you aren't happy with .	neutral	3
3175	I'm sure it'll be fine . How about my PIN number ?	neutral	2
3176	That will be sent on to you within 2 working days . Then , you can start using your new card .	neutral	3
3177	Great . I'll be in later today . Thanks for calling . Bye .	happiness	1
3178	What are we eating for lunch ?	neutral	2
3179	I have no idea . What about you ?	neutral	2
3180	I kind of want pizza .	neutral	1
3181	I ate pizza the other day .	neutral	1
3182	So , what do you feel like eating then ?	neutral	2
3183	How about some burgers ?	neutral	3
3184	I already had a burger yesterday .	neutral	4
3185	What are we going to do ?	neutral	2
3186	We can just each get what we want to get .	neutral	3
3187	That sounds like a plan .	happiness	4
3188	Do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ?	neutral	2
3189	I think they sell both at the cafeteria .	neutral	1
3190	Did you bring your certificate for nursing ?	neutral	2
3191	Yes , here is my Certificate of Nurse .	neutral	1
3192	How about your nursing education ?	neutral	2
3193	I learnt nursing through theory and practice for 3 years at Hunan Nursing School .	neutral	1
3194	Can you manage English conversation ?	neutral	2
3195	Yes , pretty well . I have started learning English since primary school .	neutral	1
3196	Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ?	neutral	2
3197	My husband and I have thought about it , but we've decided not to have any . They're just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of Worl	neutral	1
3198	Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ?	neutral	2
3199	For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share .	neutral	1
3200	Don't you think you would miss having other people around ?	neutral	2
3201	No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy	neutral	1
3202	If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ?	neutral	2
3203	That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like	neutral	1
3204	Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?	neutral	2
3205	I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children !	neutral	1
3206	Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses !	neutral	3
3207	I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .	neutral	4
3208	Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .	neutral	3
3209	So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ?	neutral	2
3210	Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .	neutral	1
3211	Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ?	happiness	2
3212	No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .	neutral	1
3213	You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned .	neutral	3
3214	Is Tom in ?	neutral	2
3215	No , he is at work now .	neutral	1
3216	May I have his office phone number please ?	neutral	3
3217	Sure . It's 289,1234 .	neutral	4
3218	What about driving to Shanghai ?	neutral	3
3219	Driving ? No way , it's too far .	neutral	4
3220	I just thought it would be an interesting way to see lots of places . How long will it take ?	neutral	3
3221	Too long , and you do not have much time .	neutral	4
3222	What a pity .	sadness	1
3223	Good afternoon . I'll show you to your room .	neutral	3
3224	Thank you .	neutral	4
3225	Could you tell me which bags are yours ?	neutral	3
3226	They're over there next to the door . Those three with green tags on them .	neutral	4
3227	Could you wait a moment ? I have to get a trolley . May I see your room key , please ?	neutral	3
3228	Sure , here it is .	neutral	4
3229	Thank you . Room 402 . You're on the 4th floor . This way , please .	neutral	3
3230	Excuse me , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ?	neutral	2
3231	Yes . I bought the can two days ago , but today I found that is beyond the guarantee period .	neutral	1
3232	Let me see . I am sorry , sir . We will change another one for you . Please wait a moment .	sadness	3
3233	Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ?	neutral	3
3234	The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street .	neutral	3
3235	How long will it take me to get there ?	neutral	2
3236	It's about a ten-minute walk .	neutral	1
3237	That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .	happiness	4
3238	Not at all .	happiness	1
3239	Excuse me ! Does this bus go to the railway station ?	neutral	2
3240	No , You're got on the wrong bus . You can take a No . 22 bus at the University station and then transfer to a No . 83 bus at the railway station .	neutral	1
3241	OK ! Thank you very much !	happiness	1
3242	I have here our price sheet on a F . O . B . basis . The prices are given without engagement .	neutral	1
3243	Good , if you ’ ll excuse me , I ’ ll go over the sheet right now .	neutral	3
3244	Take your time .	neutral	4
3245	I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high .	neutral	1
3246	I ’ m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years .	neutral	1
3247	We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ?	neutral	3
3248	Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly .	neutral	3
3249	The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first .	neutral	3
3250	Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent .	neutral	3
3251	When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent .	neutral	4
3252	How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ?	neutral	2
3253	To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help .	neutral	3
3254	Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ?	neutral	4
3255	I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ?	neutral	3
3256	Very well , I will .	neutral	4
3257	Excuse me , you look lost.Can I help you ?	neutral	2
3258	Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station .	happiness	3
3259	Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right .	neutral	3
3260	Right ? OK , got it .	neutral	4
3261	Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ?	neutral	3
3262	Next left then right ? OK .	neutral	4
3263	I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said .	neutral	3
3264	I said , ' Do you want me to help you ? '	neutral	4
3265	I'm trying to find a post office .	neutral	1
3266	Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there .	neutral	3
3267	Should I take the bus ?	neutral	2
3268	No . It'll only take about five minutes to walk .	neutral	1
3269	Thank you very much .	happiness	1
3270	Anytime .	happiness	1
3271	It says here that you graduated from Beijing Normal University with a major in English Language and Literature .	neutral	1
3272	Right . Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background .	neutral	1
3273	Yes .	neutral	1
3274	But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate .	neutral	1
3275	So you must be an extravert ?	neutral	1
3276	Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them .	neutral	1
3277	What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ?	neutral	2
3278	A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment .	neutral	1
3279	Don't you consider it a hard work ?	neutral	2
3280	Hard but interesting , I think .	neutral	1
3281	Have you any experience as a tourist guide ?	neutral	2
3282	Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University .	neutral	1
3283	Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ?	neutral	2
3284	Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well .	neutral	1
3285	Didn ’ t you punch in this morning , Monica ?	neutral	2
3286	Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching .	neutral	1
3287	That ’ s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule .	neutral	3
3288	Do we also need to punch out after work ?	neutral	2
3289	According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day .	neutral	3
3290	How about the lunch break , Lucy ?	neutral	2
3291	From 11 thirty to 1 o ’ clock .	neutral	1
3292	May I ask whether we need to work overtime ?	neutral	3
3293	Sometimes , but not quite often .	neutral	1
3294	This needs dry-cleaning.Can you remove this stain without harming the fabric ?	neutral	3
3295	Let me see . We ’ ll try , but I ’ m not sure that we can remove it .	neutral	4
3296	Ok , then . We ’ ll I ’ d also like to have this pressed .	neutral	3
3297	Any starch ?	neutral	2
3298	No starch .	neutral	1
3299	What's the problem ?	neutral	2
3300	I have a laceration on my left forearm .	neutral	1
3301	Let me have a look . How did this happen ?	neutral	2
3302	I got hit by a car in an accident .	neutral	1
3303	Was there much bleeding afterward ?	neutral	2
3304	No , not much .	neutral	1
3305	Well , this doesn't look too serious . Nurse , could you please get me a suture set ?	neutral	3
3306	Will I need stitches ?	neutral	2
3307	Yes . Three , I think . It wont ' be too painful . Alright , we're done . That wasn't so bad , was it ?	neutral	2
3308	No , not really .	neutral	1
3309	You're lucky there was no lasting damage . I'll set up an appointment for you to come back in five days . We'll take those stitches out then . So long .	neutral	3
3310	Thank you , doctor . Bye .	happiness	4
3311	What time is it ?	neutral	2
3312	Ten to nine .	neutral	1
3313	Your watch is ten minutes slow . So it's should be nine sharp . I'm gonna be late again . What will be my excuse this time ? It should be set the alarm for seven thirty .	neutral	3
3314	Don't cry over spilled milk , Fred ? Could you stay with me a few minutes ?	neutral	3
3315	What ? Why ? What's wrong with you ?	neutral	2
3316	I just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking.It ' s so lonely and boring . My sickness makes it worse . When will I recover ?	sadness	1
3317	You will be fine in the couple of month , just be patient . I've got to woke now , I'll be late .	neutral	1
3318	You only care about your work .	sadness	1
3319	Sorry , baby , you are everything to me . all I do just for our family .	neutral	1

3331	Very good , sir . We will be expecting you next Monday , the 12th .	neutral	1
3332	How is the result of your lab test ?	neutral	2
3333	When it comes to that , I have a lot to say .	neutral	1
3334	Then say it .	neutral	3
3335	When I went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests , I tried to keep a poker face even though I was scared to death . Then you guess what he said .	neutral	2
3336	That ’ s just what I want to know .	neutral	1
3337	He told me the tests were negative and there was nothing wrong with me .	happiness	1
3338	Could you tell me something about your family ?	neutral	3
3339	OK . There are five people in my family , Father , mother , elder brother , younger sister and I .	neutral	1
3340	Are your brother and sister still in school ?	neutral	2
3341	My brother has found his job and my sister is still in college .	neutral	1
3342	What does your father do ?	neutral	2
3343	My father is a middle school teacher .	neutral	1
3344	What about your mother ?	neutral	2
3345	My mother is a housewife .	neutral	1
3346	Are you married ?	neutral	2
3347	I am not married yet and I live alone now .	neutral	1
3348	Do you need to support your family ?	neutral	2
3349	No , my father and brother are doing that .	neutral	1
3350	Have you finished school ?	neutral	2
3351	Yes , I have already graduated .	neutral	1
3352	I'm in heaven ! A Whirlpool dryer !	happiness	1
3353	I love them , too . Let's move into the kitchen . Wait until you see the refrigerator .	happiness	3
3354	This is too good to be true .	happiness	1
3355	And the stove is brand new . You know how to use a gas stove , right ?	happiness	2
3356	Yes . We've lived in Taiwan for a while . I had a gas stove in the States , too .	happiness	1
3357	It's better for cooking Chinese food . Well , what do you think ?	happiness	2
3358	We love it . But we'd like to know about the neighbors .	happiness	1
3359	How's your new car ?	neutral	2
3360	Perfect ! Couldn't be better .	neutral	1
3361	You made a good choice , then ?	neutral	2
3362	It's just what I want .	neutral	1
3363	No regrets ?	neutral	2
3364	I am really pleased with it .	happiness	1
3365	I am glad you are happy .	happiness	1
3366	It's super .	happiness	1
3367	Good afternoon , Sir . You're here to see about a Temporary Loan , right ? The loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets . Is that what you require ?	neutral	2
3368	Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ?	neutral	2
3369	Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period .	neutral	1
3370	Is there any flexibility on that ?	neutral	3
3371	Unfortunately , not .	neutral	4
3372	OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan .	neutral	3
3373	Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away .	neutral	4
3374	Mr . Wang , I've had scheduled for your two days stay in Shanghai . You can make some changes if it does not suit you .	neutral	3
3375	All right . Please read it to me .	neutral	3
3376	On Friday morning , Mr . Wang , the director of Shanghai Research Institute , will visit you at the hotel . In the afternoon , you will discuss some problems with Mr . Yang , vice manager of computer corporation .	neutral	1
3377	Very good .	neutral	1
3378	On Saturday , you'll leave the hotel for sightseeing . Miss Lu will be your guide .	neutral	3
3379	Oh , that's great .	happiness	4
3380	Hi , I would like to return this TV .	neutral	3
3381	Sure , do you have the receipt ?	neutral	2
3382	Yeah here you go . Actually I also want to return this keyboard .	neutral	1
3383	Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ?	neutral	3
3384	The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear .	neutral	4
3385	I see , and what about the keyboard ?	neutral	2
3386	I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work .	neutral	1
3387	I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages .	sadness	1
3388	Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways .	anger	1
3389	There are so many people that the tickets are all sold out !	neutral	1
3390	Luckily we got the last two .	neutral	1
3391	Look , Danny . The Four Great Inventions !	surprise	1
3392	Gunpowder , compass , the paper making , and the printing .	neutral	1
3393	I really admire those who made such great inventions !	neutral	1
3394	May , I don't see why they are great . They are just simple things .	neutral	1
3395	They look simple today . But they were milestones in their times .	neutral	1
3396	Milestones ? May , you must be kidding .	surprise	2
3397	Just think Bill Gates , those inventions are as important as the windows system .	neutral	1
3398	Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them .	neutral	1
3399	No , quite the contrary .	neutral	1
3400	Why ? Didn't you say that they were milestones ?	neutral	2
3401	Yes , but they went to the public without any patent protection .	neutral	1
3402	Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates .	neutral	1
3403	What can I do for you ?	neutral	2
3404	I need some medicine .	neutral	3
3405	For whom ?	neutral	2
3406	My wife . She suffers from a bad cold .	neutral	1
3407	What symptoms does she have ?	neutral	2
3408	Fever and a bad cough .	neutral	1
3409	I see . Don't worry , just a common cold .	neutral	1
3410	What kind of medicine does she need ?	neutral	2
3411	Patulin will be enough .	neutral	3
3412	How many pills for each time ?	neutral	2
3413	Nine pills per day , and three pills after each meal .	neutral	3
3414	Thank you very much .	neutral	4
3415	It's my pleasure .	neutral	1
3416	Do you believe in god ?	neutral	2
3417	Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . do you ?	neutral	2
3418	I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ?	neutral	2
3419	I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one .	neutral	1
3420	I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet .	neutral	1
3421	I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .	neutral	1
3422	For example ?	neutral	2
3423	Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics .	neutral	1
3424	Yes . Such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs .	neutral	1
3425	Didn't you say your friend was American ? Where is she going on her honeymoon ?	neutral	2
3426	They're going skiing in Colorado .	neutral	1
3427	What a coincidence ! These pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon !	happiness	1
3428	You're probably right . Oh , what the heck ! I'll take it all ... in maroon , like you said .	happiness	1
3429	What a terrible house !	anger	1
3430	I'm sick of it , too .	neutral	1
3431	The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart .	anger	1
3432	It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out .	neutral	1
3433	Sure .	neutral	1
3434	Hello !	neutral	1
3435	Is that Sue ?	neutral	2
3436	Speaking .	neutral	1
3437	A.This is George .	neutral	1
3438	Hello , George.What ' s up ?	neutral	2
3439	This website offers very convenient air tickets booking service . It is quick and accurate .	happiness	1
3440	Yes , I once booked there . They give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e-mail . You can conveniently pay by credit card , so the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes . They also provide e-tickets , meaning you don ’ t need to go to any office to pick an air ticket . You go to the airport directly and check in with your ID card .	neutral	1
3441	So it has attracted more and more customers these days .	neutral	1
3442	Yes , therefore they are expanding the scope of their service . For example , hotels can be booked through the same site as well .	neutral	1
3443	Excuse me .	neutral	1
3444	Hello sir , may I help you ?	neutral	2
3445	Yes . Can I see that T-shirt on the top shelf please ?	neutral	3
3446	Sure . Here it is .	neutral	4
3447	How much does it cost ?	neutral	2
3448	50 dollars .	neutral	1
3449	50 dollars . That's too much .	surprise	1
3450	How about this one ? It's on sale for only 35 dollars .	neutral	3
3451	I don't like that one .	neutral	4
3452	How about the one next to the black gloves ? It's very similar to the one you like .	neutral	3
3453	That's nice . How much is it ?	neutral	2
3454	30 dollars .	neutral	1
3455	That'll be fine .	neutral	4
3456	Is this color OK , or would you like a different color ?	neutral	2
3457	That blue one's fine .	neutral	1
3458	Do you need any more of these shirts ?	neutral	2
3459	Yes .	neutral	1
3460	How many do you want ?	neutral	2
3461	I'll take two more , a red one and a white one .	neutral	1
3462	Hello , this is Li Bo speaking .	neutral	1
3463	Hi , I am Liu Ming . I am calling to tell you that I have got the job .	neutral	1
3464	Oh , that is wonderful . Congratulations !	happiness	1
3465	I really feel grateful to you for your reference . They have mentioned this in the job interview .	happiness	1
3466	Don't mention it . I think that is because you have right qualifications and nice personality .	happiness	1
3467	Thanks again . I will start on next Monday . I am sure I will have good performance .	happiness	1
3468	I agree .	neutral	1
3469	I am a student in Cambridge University . I read your ad , I want to know something more about your room , please ?	neutral	3
3470	It's a big bedroom with a drawing room , facing a beautiful wood .	neutral	4
3471	Is there a bathroom ?	neutral	2
3472	No , but there is one downstairs , which my daughter used some years ago .	neutral	1
3473	It sounds good . Could I go and see it myself ?	happiness	3
3474	Certainly , you're welcome anytime .	neutral	4
3475	See you later !	neutral	1
3476	( after a while ) Good afternoon , Mrs . Smith . I called you just now .	neutral	1
3477	Welcome ! Come in , please !	happiness	3
3478	Yes .	neutral	4
3479	This way please . Your room is upstairs ... Here it is .	neutral	3
3480	Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room . Ah , a beautiful window , through which I can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . How nice !	happiness	4
3481	Yes , if you want to wash something , there is a separate lavatory room outside .	neutral	1
3482	Excellent ! I like it ! When can I move in ?	happiness	2
3483	Anytime you like .	neutral	1
3484	OK .	happiness	1
3485	Hello , this is Dunlin . May I speak to Mrs Smith ?	neutral	3
3486	This is Mrs Smith . Can I help you ?	neutral	2
3487	I am calling to say thank you for the interview yesterday .	happiness	1
3488	You are welcome . I am very impressed by your capability .	happiness	1
3489	Is there anything I should do ?	neutral	2
3490	No , nothing . It's thoughtful of you to call me again .	neutral	1
3491	Thank you . Please call me at any time if you have any questions .	neutral	3
3492	Ok , I will . Do you have any question ?	neutral	2
3493	No , thank you . Goodbye .	neutral	1
3494	Goodbye .	neutral	1
3495	Hi there . Welcome to Lincoln Corporate Services . How can we help ?	neutral	2
3496	Hi . I was wondering what kind of fixed asset loans you have ? Do you have Fixed Asset Loans ?	neutral	2
3497	Yes , we do . You'll go through the acceptance application , then a first review , then an evaluation and examination and finally get approval . Why don't you read through this brochure ? It outlines all of the important aspects of the loan , the terms and conditions , etc .	neutral	3
3498	That's a good idea , to familiarise myself with it . Then , I'll be back if we decide to go ahead .	neutral	4
3499	There are many art craft items in this shop . I suggest you take your time , and you might find something you like .	neutral	3
3500	That's what I am going to do .	neutral	4
3501	If you have any problem , please come to me .	neutral	3
3502	I surely will . How much is this wood carving ?	neutral	2
3503	You are an expert on it . That wood carving is very rare . But I'm so sorry . that is not for sell .	neutral	1
3504	That's OK . Is anything else recommended ?	neutral	2
3505	Do you have any special request ?	neutral	2
3506	I'd like to see some traditional arts .	neutral	1
3507	So that means you are shopping for presents ?	neutral	2
3508	Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends .	neutral	1
3509	Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle .	neutral	3
3510	Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut .	happiness	4
3511	I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best .	neutral	1
3512	You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale .	neutral	2
3513	As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country .	neutral	1
3514	Wow , you are the expert on it .	happiness	1
3515	Operator . Can I help you ?	neutral	2
3516	I'd like to make a person-to-person call to Beijing , China . The number is 2135367 8 , and I want to speak to Mr . Zhang .	neutral	3
3517	To Mr . Zhang in at 2135-3678 ?	neutral	2
3518	Yes , that's right .	neutral	1
3519	May I have your name and telephone number ?	neutral	3
3520	My name is Luo Gang , and the phone number is 513-3284 .	neutral	4
3521	Mr . Luo , will you hold the line , please - - - Mr . Luo , there is no Zhang at that number . Will you check the number again , please ?	neutral	3
3522	What the number I gave you , operator ?	neutral	2
3523	It's 2135-3678 .	neutral	1
3524	Oh , I'm sorry . should have been 2135-3668 , not 3678 . I've given you a wrong number .	sadness	4
3525	Are you sure this time ?	neutral	2
3526	Yes .	neutral	1
3527	OK . Let me try again .	neutral	1
3528	Thank you .	happiness	1
3529	Are there any special requirements on the project ? And shall we talk around it in details ?	neutral	3
3530	Yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . Besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness .	neutral	3
3531	That's a good idea . We can improve our technology to meet your special need .	neutral	4
3532	And please let white color dominate .	neutral	3
3533	OK ! I've noted it down . And any others ?	neutral	4
3534	Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city .	neutral	3
3535	I'll tell them .	neutral	4
3536	Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor .	neutral	3
3537	Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery .	neutral	4
3538	Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you .	happiness	1
3539	I think so . Bye !	happiness	1
3540	Bye !	happiness	1
3541	Mr . Black , I ' d like to take some time off . I ' Ve been feeling exhausted these days .	neutral	3
3542	That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ?	neutral	2
3543	Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off .	neutral	3
3544	That's long leave . How's your project coming along ?	neutral	2
3545	The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on .	neutral	3
3546	Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave .	neutral	3
3547	Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients .	neutral	1
3548	Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed .	neutral	3
3549	I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black .	neutral	4
3550	Did you ever get a parking ticket ?	neutral	2
3551	Only a few .	neutral	1
3552	What's a few ?	neutral	2
3553	I've gotten six , I think .	neutral	1
3554	Did you pay your fines ?	neutral	2
3555	Of course I have .	neutral	1
3556	How much are the parking tickets ?	neutral	2
3557	I think they're $ 130 .	neutral	1
3558	That's expensive .	neutral	1
3559	I just got a parking ticket .	neutral	1
3560	You should probably pay the fine soon .	neutral	3
3561	I'm going to pay it today .	neutral	4
3562	Are you doing anything right now , Diana ?	neutral	2
3563	I am typing a report for the moment , Mr . Robbins . Anything I need to do ?	neutral	2
3564	Will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter ?	neutral	3
3565	Is it urgent ?	neutral	2
3566	Yes , this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5 . It's about a contract .	neutral	1
3567	Ok , I am coming .	neutral	4
3568	Please take a seat , Diana . Have you got your spare pens and pencils ?	neutral	2
3569	Yes , I have this time . But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ?	neutral	3
3570	No , I ’ d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter .	neutral	4
3571	All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments .	neutral	2
3572	Of course , Diana . You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it .	neutral	3
3573	Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ?	neutral	4
3574	Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list .	neutral	3
3575	You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ?	neutral	2
3576	Right . And the last thing , we are going to clean the files out tomorrow . Now let's begin .	neutral	3
3577	You're finally here ! What took so long ?	happiness	2
3578	I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection .	neutral	1
3579	It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .	neutral	3
3580	I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest .	neutral	4
3581	perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work .	neutral	3
3582	I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good .	neutral	4
3583	It would be better for the environment , too .	neutral	1
3584	I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city .	neutral	1
3585	Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well .	neutral	1
3586	The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car .	neutral	1
3587	Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides .	neutral	1
3588	That's true . I could certainly use the exercise !	happiness	1
3589	So , are you going to quit driving to work then ?	neutral	2
3590	Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment .	neutral	1
3591	That's really convenient . We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though .	neutral	3
3592	I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand .	neutral	4
3593	That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out .	neutral	1
3594	Sure , for at least three thousand per month .	neutral	1
3595	That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for .	neutral	1
3596	I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent .	happiness	1
3597	Hello . I sent out my laundry yesterday.Aren ' t they ready ?	neutral	2
3598	They'll be ready by this afternoon .	neutral	1
3599	Oh , no ! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning .	surprise	1
3600	Is that right ? We're very sorry .	sadness	2
3601	"I thought it was "" the same day "" service.Anyway , please do hurry ."	neutral	3
3602	I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .	sadness	4
3603	Well , then , would you send it to Japan , please ?	neutral	3
3604	Yes , we'll do so .	neutral	4
3605	Hello , welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ?	neutral	2
3606	I want to effect payment under an L / C today .	neutral	3
3607	No problem . OK ... just checking for you . Ah , I'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction . What you can do is buy some US dollars , using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount .	neutral	3
3608	That seems alright . What's the exchange rate like today ? Good or bad ?	neutral	2
3609	It's not too bad today , actually . 828.23 .	neutral	1
3610	How can I help you , sir ?	neutral	2
3611	I am here to have a discussion on your company's investment issue .	neutral	3
3612	Sorry , could you tell me your name ?	neutral	3
3613	I am James Pond from FAM Company and I am here to discuss it with Nova .	neutral	1
3614	Do you have an appointment ?	neutral	2
3615	Yes , I did it yesterday . Our meeting should be 2 pm .	neutral	1
3616	I guess she forgot your meeting . She is attending an important meeting in the company . Will you have a seat ? May I leave a memo for her ?	neutral	2
3617	Thank you .	neutral	1
3618	She will be back soon .	neutral	3
3619	Excuse me . Would you please make a suit with this material ?	neutral	3
3620	Sure . May I take your measurements ?	neutral	3
3621	Please don't make it too tight . This is for autumn wear , so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath .	neutral	4
3622	I see , sir . Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th , that's in a week's time ?	neutral	3
3623	The 10th ? I'm sorry , but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th . Could you have the suit ready by the 8th , or at the latest , the 9th ?	neutral	3
3624	Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ?	neutral	3
3625	That's fine , thank you .	happiness	4
3626	Good morning everyone . Thank you for attending the meeting today . I'm sure you all have a copy of the agenda . So let's get started with the first issue .	neutral	3
3627	We're here today to present to you the results of our marketing research regarding the consumer behavior .	neutral	3
3628	I would like to begin by introducing our foreign guests to our stuff on your left ( right ) , we have Mr . Brown , who is Vice President of Sales . Next to him is Ms .

3629	I am glad to see everyone is here and on time . Let's get started ! Susan , toss out some of your ideas .	neutral	3
3630	It seems that many boys are fighting there .	neutral	1
3631	Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus .	anger	1
3632	the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again !	anger	1
3633	exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment .	neutral	1
3634	on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .	anger	1
3635	as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health .	neutral	1
3636	I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse	neutral	1
3637	what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?	neutral	2
3638	it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .	neutral	1
3639	I see , so it's similar to global warming ?	neutral	2
3640	they're related to one another , yes .	neutral	1
3641	I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .	neutral	1
3642	people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .	neutral	1
3643	people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .	neutral	1
3644	I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place .	neutral	1
3645	Would you like some cookies ? I just made them .	neutral	2
3646	Thank you . Yes , I would .	happiness	1
3647	These are chocolate , and those are almond-flavored .	neutral	1
3648	I guess I'll try a chocolate one first.Mmmm ... this is delicious.Are they hard to make ?	neutral	2
3649	No , they're really quite easy . Wait a minute , I've got the recipe right here.See ... these are the ingredients , and then you just follow the directions .	neutral	1
3650	That does look easy . I think I'll make some tonight .	happiness	1
3651	Can I help you ?	neutral	2
3652	I'd like to buy a ticket to Casablanca on flight US125 tomorrow .	neutral	1
3653	Hold on , plese.It will take off at 14:00 tomorrow.The price is $ 110 .	neutral	1
3654	Well , I want to stay under $ 100 .	neutral	3
3655	I am sorry Sir . We won't give any discount in busy seasons.The price is the same .	neutral	4
3656	How do you use an ATM card , Billy ?	neutral	2
3657	It ’ s easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers .	neutral	1
3658	Oh yes . I ’ Ve got it written down here . Just a minute .	neutral	3
3659	You really shouldn ’ t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like .	neutral	4
3660	Ok , I ’ Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don ’ t I ?	neutral	2
3661	Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want .	neutral	1
3662	I can just enter the amount using the key , right ?	neutral	2
3663	That ’ s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money .	neutral	1
3664	These machines aren ’ t very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk .	happiness	1
3665	Hello , is Jennifer in ?	neutral	2
3666	I am sorry , you have the wrong number .	sadness	1
3667	Oh , I am really sorry .	sadness	1
3668	Can you give me a hand with the dishes ?	neutral	3
3669	Sure . Should I wash or dry ?	neutral	2
3670	I wash and you'll dry .	neutral	3
3671	OK . Let's do it .	neutral	4
3672	Excuse me , do you have the latest issue of Newsworld ?	neutral	2
3673	Yes , this week's issue just came in . Here it is .	neutral	1
3674	How about Music Madness ?	neutral	2
3675	Let me check ... yes , we got the October issue a few days ago . It's on that shelf over there .	neutral	1
3676	Okay , I'll take these two magazines and a copy of Today's Post .	neutral	3
3677	Good afternoon , Miss . What can I do for you ?	neutral	2
3678	Could you tell me my account balance ? My account number is ...	neutral	3
3679	Just a moment , please . Your name ?	neutral	2

3685	We will go to Luoyang for a vacation next month .	neutral	1
3686	How long will you stay there ?	neutral	2
3687	About one week .	neutral	1
3688	Where will you live during the vacation .	neutral	2
3689	In the hotel .	neutral	1
3690	Have you made a reservation ?	neutral	2
3691	Yes , we have .	neutral	1
3692	That's OK .	neutral	1
3693	You look great ! How do you stay in such good shape ?	neutral	2
3694	Well , I go jogging every morning , eat a healthful diet and work out in a gymnasium twice a week .	neutral	1
3695	Wow , it sounds like a lot of work . I guess I'm too lazy to do all that .	neutral	1
3696	Bob from accounting is on the line . Do you want to speak with him ?	neutral	2
3697	Yes , I need to talk to him .	neutral	3
3698	I'll put the call through then .	neutral	3
3699	Thank you .	neutral	4
3700	I want to send some money to Australia . Could you handle it for me ?	neutral	3
3701	Yes , madam , how much would you like to remit ?	neutral	2
3702	2,000 AD $ .	neutral	1
3703	Which would you like to remit , by mail or by cable ?	neutral	2
3704	What is the difference between them ?	neutral	2
3705	The cable will take less time for your account , in the meantime , the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one .	neutral	1
3706	Well , I think the cable is better .	neutral	3
3707	OK , please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary , your name and telephone .	neutral	3
3708	All right . Here you are .	neutral	4
3709	Everything is OK . The commission is 50 yuan .	neutral	3
3710	Here you are . Thanks a lot .	happiness	4
3711	Kate , can we change the channel ?	neutral	3
3712	Why ?	neutral	2
3713	This channel has so many advertisements , and it doesn't have any good TV programs .	neutral	1
3714	OK . You can change it .	neutral	4
3715	What about this one ? Do you like this program ?	neutral	2
3716	No , I think it is very boring . Can you change it to Channel Twelve , please ?	neutral	3
3717	Yes . Oh , it's a talk show .	neutral	4
3718	Yeah , it's very funny . Have you ever watched it before ?	neutral	2
3719	No , I haven't . This is my first time to watch it .	neutral	1
3720	I'm sure you will like it .	neutral	1
3721	Excuse me , is there any summer resort around the town ?	neutral	2
3722	As far as I know , the nearest one is next to the Willdon .	neutral	1
3723	It doesn't matter . I just want to have a relax and I don't care how far it is . Can you tell me how to get there ?	neutral	3
3724	Yes , take the greyhound bus . It will lead you directly there .	neutral	4
3725	Thanks a billion .	happiness	1
3726	Every honored guests , welcome to Hang Thou . Now we are visiting Tiger-running Spring .	neutral	1
3727	How can we relate tiger to this spot , Miss Zhang ?	neutral	2
3728	Its name originates from a legend that two tigers run here and made a hole , and then a spring gushed out from it .	neutral	1
3729	How ignorant I am !	neutral	1
3730	The Longing Tea and the Tiger-running Spring water are always considered as the “ Two Wonders in West Lake . ”	neutral	1
3731	I know that tea . It smells fragrant .	neutral	1
3732	That's right . All my guests , attention please . We will have half an hour to visit the spring and take photos . And next spot will be the Moon Reflected in Three Pools .	neutral	3

3737	No problem . Wait a moment .	neutral	4
3738	May I speak to Mr . Baker ?	neutral	3
3739	I ’ m afraid he's not in .	neutral	4
3740	Will you ask him to call me collect when he ’ s back ?	neutral	3
3741	Certainly . May I ask who ’ s calling , please ?	neutral	2
3742	Yes , this is Cindy Wang of A & B Trading Company in New York .	neutral	1
3743	I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too title .	neutral	3
3744	I'm not sure I can't agree , dan	neutral	4
3745	Why not ?	neutral	2
3746	Surely , there are other ways to save money .	neutral	3
3747	What are you talking about , we tried everything !	surprise	4
3748	I've got some great news for you !	happiness	3
3749	Did you get the position you wanted ?	neutral	2
3750	Yes , I'll be promoted to department manager .	happiness	1

3768	But the direction book says I will get one-year warranty .	neutral	1
3769	Yes , I know . After 90 days , you need to call the company that manufactured the vacuum to fix it because it ’ s still under their warranty . Their phone number should be in the direction book that came with your vacuum .	neutral	1
3770	Okay . I understand . I ’ ll call the Customer Service Office of the manufacturer . Thank you .	happiness	1
3771	You ’ re welcome .	happiness	1

3786	That's ok . I'm expecting a lift from my friend .	neutral	4
3787	Can you tell me a little bit about yourself ?	neutral	3

3797	Sorry , I overslept . My clock didn't go off this morning .	sadness	1
3798	Again ?	neutral	2
3799	That's right , even though I did set the alarm last night .	neutral	1
3800	Your clock never works . Perhaps you should buy a new one .	neutral	3
3801	Well , if it breaks down again tomorrow , I'll definitely buy a new one .	neutral	4
3802	I was really glad to hear about your award . Congratulations !	happiness	1

3808	Where do you keep the dishes , Baker ?	neutral	2
3809	They ’ re in the cabinet above the dishwasher .	neutral	1
3810	And the forks and spoons ?	neutral	2
3811	They ’ re in that drawer .	neutral	1

3817	I really enjoyed our evening together , Todd .	happiness	1
3818	I had fun also and was wondering if you would like to go hiking with me in the mountains on Saturday .	happiness	3
3819	Hiking would be perfect ! May I bring along a picnic lunch for us to share ?	happiness	3
3820	A picnic lunch would be a nice thing to have along .	happiness	4
3821	I'll work on the lunch , and you can work out the details of where we will go . What time will you be at my house ?	neutral	2
3822	Nine would be good , don't you think ?	neutral	3
3823	Nine is good . See you on Saturday !	neutral	4

3833	Thanks . Good-bye .	happiness	1
3834	Do you want to know what really motivates Vince to be nice to me ?	neutral	2
3835	OK . What ?	neutral	2
3836	It isn't gratitude . It's fear . Vince is afraid I'll jump to a competitor .	neutral	1
3837	You wouldn't do that . Would you ?	neutral	3
3838	I might . Vince knows he needs to keep me happy .	neutral	4
3839	What about your accounts ?	neutral	2

3852	what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?	neutral	2
3853	it's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain .	neutral	1
3854	that doesn't sound pretty .	neutral	1
3855	do you have any plans for tomorrow ?	neutral	2
3856	well , I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends .	neutral	1
3857	you might want to change your plans . With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery .	neutral	1
3858	I suppose I should . I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . Do you have any plans for tomorrow ?	neutral	2

3866	Certainly . The product has a two-year guarantee . If it breaks down during that period we offer a replacement unit completely free of charge . Our products are very reliable but we recommend you take out an extended warranty . This covers you for a further two years .	neutral	4
3867	I see . What does that include ?	neutral	2
3868	It covers all parts and labour , except for normal wear and tear of course .	neutral	1
3869	What sort of response time do you guarantee ?	neutral	2
3870	Our engineers are on call 24 hours a day . We guarantee someone will be with you within four hours , but in practice it's often much sooner .	neutral	1
3871	Are there any exclusions ?	neutral	2
3872	Not really . It's a very comprehensive warranty . I ’ ll put a copy in the post to you and you can read through the small print .	neutral	1
3873	Do you have any particular conditions that you would like our company to take into consideration ?	neutral	2
3874	No , nothing in particular .	neutral	1
3875	All right . If we decide to hire you , we'd pay you two thousand and five hundred yuan a month at the start . You can have Saturdays and Sundays off . Besides , you may have a paid month holiday every year . How do you think about it ?	neutral	2
3876	As regards salary , I leave it to you to decide after experience of capacity .	neutral	1
3877	Well , we'll give you our decision in a couple of days . It's a pleasure to talk to you , Mr . Liu .	neutral	3
3878	Thank you , Mr . White . I really appreciate your assistance .	happiness	4
3879	Did you ever buy food from the snack stands near our hotel ?	neutral	2
3880	Yes , several times .	neutral	1
3881	How do you like them ?	neutral	2
3882	Not bad .	neutral	1
3883	I always have the temptation to eat something there .	neutral	1
3884	Then , why didn't you do that ?	neutral	2
3885	I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ?	neutral	2
3886	Some of them , I think , are not good .	neutral	1
3887	It doesn't taste good ?	neutral	2
3888	No , I mean some of them are not clean enough .	neutral	1
3889	That's my greatest concern . But how can you tell which one is clean ?	neutral	2
3890	I judge by appearances .	neutral	1
3891	I got it . I think it's worth trying .	neutral	1
3892	It certainly is .	neutral	1
3893	I'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things .	neutral	1
3894	Don't try everything at one time , please .	neutral	3
3895	I see . Thank you .	happiness	4
3896	I need my minibar restocked .	neutral	3
3897	Everything is gone , sir ?	neutral	2
3898	There's not a drop left of anything .	neutral	1
3899	Is there anything in particular you want ?	neutral	2
3900	Yes , the Perrier and the Jim Beam hit the spot . Let me have three more of each .	neutral	3
3901	Got it . Anything else ?	neutral	2
3902	I really liked the apples . Bring me a couple of apples , please .	neutral	3
3903	Not a problem . Anything else ?	neutral	2
3904	Oh , yes , one more thing	neutral	3
3905	Someone will be up shortly with your order , sir .	neutral	4
3906	I will travel to Southeast Asia this summer , so I need to exchange some US dollars . Can I get the foreign currency at any bank ?	neutral	2
3907	I don't think you can . In China , our currency is not freely convertible yet .	neutral	1
3908	Do you mean there is no way to get any foreign money ?	neutral	2
3909	No . You can go to the Bank of China to exchange some US dollars at the current exchange rate of the day you exchange them . The maximum amount you can exchange is $ 2,000 .	neutral	1
3910	Only $ 2,000 ? Are there any other ways to get the money exchanged ?	surprise	2
3911	The only official way is to go to Bank of China .	neutral	1
3912	I'd better take more dollars with me . It seems that I need to borrow some from my friends .	neutral	1
3913	can you squeeze me in sometime today ?	neutral	3
3914	That ’ s a big order , Jane . I am really swamped .	neutral	4
3915	I know what you ’ re saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy .	neutral	3
3916	Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? It won ’ t take more than a half hour , will it ?	neutral	3
3917	You seem to be upset . What ’ s eating you ?	neutral	2
3918	It ’ s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves	anger	1
3919	Dick ? How come ? He used to be as meek as a lamb .	neutral	2
3920	Yes , he used to be . But now he ’ s drifting off track .	anger	1
3921	He must have been in bad company , or he wouldn ’ t be off the beans .	neutral	1
3922	Bring me some toast , please .	neutral	3
3923	Would you like butter or jam on your toast or do you just want it plain ?	neutral	2
3924	Spread some jam , please .	neutral	1
3925	Anything to drink ?	neutral	2
3926	Black coffee is fine .	neutral	1
3927	Peter , it's time to get up .	neutral	3

3933	sure . i suppose you dance much .	neutral	4
3934	oh . no as a matter of fact , i haven't danced for a long time .	neutral	1
3935	but i can see you dance wonderfully well .	happiness	1
3936	thanks for flattering me 。 i think you dance much right ?	happiness	2
3937	no , just occasionally	neutral	1

3995	Unless it ’ s marked differently , it ’ s their home numbers .	neutral	1
3996	Alright . What if I can ’ t get a hold of them by phone ?	neutral	2
3997	Then , you should e-mail them with the information .	neutral	3
3998	Where can I find their e-mail addresses ?	neutral	2
3999	They should have then listed on their resumes .	neutral	1
4000	And if there aren ’ t any e-mail addresses ?	neutral	2
4001	Then send them a SMS on their cell phone .	neutral	3
4002	Ok . That sounds easy enough . Have you called any of them yet ?	neutral	2
4003	Yes . I called the first three people on the list , but they didn ’ t pick up .	neutral	1
4004	Did you leave a voice message ?	neutral	2
4005	I left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list .	neutral	1
4006	I see . What did you tell her ?	neutral	2
4007	I told her that she should call me back at my office number .	neutral	1
4008	Ok , so , maybe I should call her again .	neutral	3
4009	Yes , that sounds like a good idea . She might not get the other message in time .	neutral	4
4010	One more question . It looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . Do you have a calling card that I can use to get through to them ?	neutral	2
4011	Sure . You can use this one . The pin number is written on the back of the card .	neutral	3

4018	Mitsubishi , HP , IBM and many other famous corporations .	neutral	1
4019	Does the 7th floor belong to our company too ?	neutral	2
4020	Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building .	neutral	1
4021	It ’ s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ?	neutral	2
4022	Yes , at the end of the hall .	neutral	1
4023	We came too early . There're still three hours before the performance starts .	neutral	1
4024	I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait .	sadness	1
4025	Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ?	neutral	3
4026	Why not ? I'd love to do that .	happiness	4
4027	Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art .	neutral	1
4028	Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ?	happiness	2
4029	Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ?	neutral	2
4030	I surely do . They must have had advanced machine in ancient China to do that .	neutral	1
4031	No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .	neutral	1
4032	Unbelievable ! I could never do that .	surprise	1
4033	Good morning . Can I see Mr Jackson , please ?	neutral	3

4037	Robert . Philips Robert .	neutral	1
4038	The environment varies greatly because of difference in language , customs and traditions .	neutral	1
4039	Yes . This gap can be filled by export market research before exporting .	neutral	1
4040	But the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers .	neutral	1
4041	That's right . They do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury .	neutral	1
4042	Therefore , when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market , they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount .	neutral	1
4043	Exactly !	happiness	1
4044	Hello , I really appreciate the opportunity to interview for this position .	neutral	1
4045	I was wondering if you like team projects , or projects that you work on alone .	neutral	2

4048	I have children so a steady job is important but I would like a chance to advance .	neutral	3

4055	I'm sorry , he's out at the moment .	neutral	4

4060	Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ?	neutral	3
4061	Ok . Does he know your number ?	neutral	2
4062	I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 .	neutral	1
4063	13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on .	neutral	3
4064	I am sorry . I didn ’ t accomplish the job on time .	sadness	1

4074	OK , here you are .	happiness	1
4075	Thank you .	happiness	1
4076	Good afternoon , madam . Is there anything I can do for you ?	neutral	2
4077	Yes , I spent so much time sightseeing here . It is already so late now . I am afraid I can't catch the last bus back to downtown .	neutral	1
4078	Don't worry . I will try to get a taxi for you . You can take it to the bus station .	happiness	1
4079	I am very grateful to your help .	happiness	1
4080	Don't mention it . It is my duty .	happiness	1

4093	Oh , hello , Tom ! Beautiful day , isn ’ t it ?	happiness	3
4094	Yes , it is !	happiness	4
4095	Excuse me , is this the Auto Consumer Loan Center ?	neutral	2
4096	Yes . Is there anything I can do for you ?	neutral	2
4097	Could you tell me something about the terms and interest rates for personal automobile consumer loan ?	neutral	3
4098	The deadline is normally no more than 5 years with the interest adopted according to the corresponding lending rates announced by the PBC .	neutral	1
4099	I plan to take the loan for 3 years .	neutral	3
4100	Well , the yearly interest rate is 5.49 % for 3 years . I'm sure you are qualified to apply for this loan .	neutral	4
4101	What about the loan repayment ?	neutral	2
4102	You may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank , for example , payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments .	neutral	3
4103	Does that mean I should deposit sufficient money to my account prior to the monthly payment date so that you can directly deduct the repayment of the principal and interest ?	neutral	2
4104	Exactly . You are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank .	neutral	1
4105	That's very thoughtful of you . Thank you so much .	happiness	1
4106	You're welcome .	happiness	1
4107	You really need to look at some of the problems we are having with the apartment .	neutral	3
4108	That apartment never had any problems before . Are you sure the problem isn ’ t you ?	neutral	2
4109	We spoke with you the first week we moved in about things that you promised to fix .	neutral	1
4110	Where do you think you have problems ?	neutral	2
4111	There is no hot water , the bedroom has a broken window , and there are rats in the kitchen .	neutral	1
4112	You know , no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before .	neutral	1
4113	You are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment .	neutral	3
4114	I will fix these problems when I get around to it .	neutral	4
4115	I will be withholding my rent check this Friday unless these problems are addressed immediately .	neutral	3
4116	You can ’ t do that ! It ’ s illegal !	anger	4
4117	I can ’ t believe these skirts are so cheap .	surprise	1
4118	I know and they are really nice , too .	neutral	1
4119	I ’ ll have to get a couple in different colors .	neutral	1
4120	Me , too .	neutral	1
4121	Buy them now though , or they might not still be here tomorrow .	neutral	3
4122	Good idea , especially at this price .	happiness	4
4123	Taxi !	neutral	3
4124	Yes , sir . Where to ?	neutral	2
4125	Wangfujing , please !	neutral	3
4126	All right .	neutral	4
4127	Oh , I like the music on your radio . It's nice .	neutral	1
4128	Thank you ! I always tune to this program when driving . So what's your favorite program ?	happiness	2
4129	I like Winner's English very mush . You know the Beijing Olympic Games is right around the corner . We should learn English Well . It's on FM 96.6 , China Business Radio . You can get it on your radio too .	neutral	1
4130	But I don't speak English at all .	neutral	1
4131	That's OK . The program is especially for the beginners like us .	neutral	1
4132	Really ? When is it on ?	neutral	2
4133	It begins at 6:40 every morning , and it goes for 20 minutes .	neutral	1
4134	Thank you so much . I'll try and catch that .	happiness	1
4135	The radio has brought us lots of convenience .	neutral	1
4136	Yes , I can also learn about the traffic condition through it .	neutral	1
4137	With the development of the society and technology , radio is nearly everywhere .	neutral	1
4138	So we should take the advantage of it .	neutral	3
4139	I ’ m thinking about getting a pet , but I ’ m really not sure which animal would be suitable . Could you give me some advice ?	neutral	3
4140	Certainly ! The first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet . Dogs are very demanding . You need to take them for walks and they love to play . Cats , on the other hand , are more independent .	neutral	4
4141	I ’ m fairly busy , so I really need an animal that I don ’ t need to care of very much . Actually , I ’ d like a pet that ’ s a little unusual . I don't ’ really want a typical pet , like a cat , dog , or hamster . Do you have any suggestions ?	neutral	2
4142	Unusual pet are often more expensive to keep . Is that a problem ?	neutral	2
4143	Not really . By the way , I don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake .	neutral	1
4144	We have those , but I only sell them to people I know well , for obvious reasons . How about a lizard ? I have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after .	neutral	1
4145	That sounds ideal . Could you show me some ?	happiness	3
4146	Sure . Come over here . As you can see , I have a wide selection of species . They can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . Do you have a favourite colour ?	neutral	2
4147	I like the red one . What do they eat ?	neutral	2
4148	You can feed them on various things . They will eat small pieces of meat , but I ’ d recommend insects . You can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . I sell them here .	neutral	1
4149	Thanks a lot . What I ’ ll do si find out more online and drop by next week .	happiness	3
4150	That ’ s fine . You shouldn ’ t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet .	neutral	4
4151	I'd like to make sure my plane reservation is in order .	neutral	3
4152	May I have your flight number , please ?	neutral	2
4153	World Airlines , Flight 201 .	neutral	1
4154	And your name , please ?	neutral	2
4155	John Anderson .	neutral	1
4156	Yes , sir . You're booked on Flight 201 , leaving in one hour .	neutral	1
4157	Thank you .	neutral	1
4158	I really think if I can get my foot in the door at this company it will do wonders for my career . Do you think you can help me polish my interview style ?	neutral	3
4159	Sure . Doing your homework and preparing for an interview really pays off .	neutral	4
4160	I ’ Ve researched the company and think I ’ m perfect for the job but I ’ m not sure how to get it across to them .	neutral	1
4161	Well first you have to have more confidence.Employers look for people who are interested , enthusiastic and sure of themselves .	neutral	3
4162	I know I have what it takes but Im worried that my work experience won ’ t sufficient . Should I inflate my experience ?	neutral	2
4163	No , you should always be upfront and honest about your weaknesses . However by focusing on your strong points and maintaining a positive attitude about your abilities , you can take the attention	neutral	3
4164	After I am accepted for unemployment benefits , what will happen next ?	neutral	2
4165	You will receive a Notice of Unemployment Insurance Award letter .	neutral	1
4166	What will that tell me ?	neutral	2
4167	The Award Letter will tell you how much you will receive weekly .	neutral	1
4168	Are there any other forms that I need to fill out ?	neutral	2
4169	You will need to fill out a Continued Claim Form every two weeks .	neutral	3
4170	What information will I need to provide on that form ?	neutral	2
4171	They will need to know where you worked and how much money you made .	neutral	1
4172	Are there any other questions on the form ?	neutral	2
4173	Basically , they want to know that you were available for work and not sick .	neutral	1
4174	Hello , I was wondering if I could talk with the apartment manager .	neutral	3
4175	I am the apartment manager . How can I help you ?	neutral	2
4176	I was wondering if the apartment on Main Street is still available .	neutral	3

4189	I ’ d like to buy a woolen vest for my grandpa .	neutral	1
4190	I ’ m sure you can find your favorite there .	neutral	1
4191	Thank you very much .	happiness	1
4192	It ’ s my honor .	happiness	1
4193	I'm ready to place an order with you , but only one condition that the goods are confined to Australia . Can you do that ?	neutral	3
4194	Well , I haven't made such arrangements with the factory yet . So I'd like to make sure if it is acceptable to the factory before making a commitment to you .	neutral	3
4195	All right , but I'm busy . How long will it be before you can finish the talk ?	neutral	2
4196	I won't be too long , I suppose . Just let me ring them , will you ?	neutral	3
4197	Go ahead .	neutral	4

4373	What may I help you with ?	neutral	2
4374	I need to file a complaint .	anger	3
4375	What is your complaint about ?	neutral	2
4376	I got robbed .	anger	1
4377	When did this happen ?	neutral	2
4378	It happened this morning .	neutral	1
4379	What was taken ?	neutral	2
4380	My wallet and cell phone .	neutral	1
4381	Did you get a good look at the person who robbed you ?	neutral	2
4382	I sure did .	neutral	1
4383	Would you able to pick him out of a line-up ?	neutral	3
4384	That shouldn't be a problem .	neutral	4
4385	Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money .	neutral	3
4386	Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ?	happiness	2
4387	Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .	neutral	3
4388	I don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate .	neutral	4
4389	But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .	neutral	3
4390	Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .	neutral	4
4391	Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash .	anger	1
4392	Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ?	neutral	2
4393	Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff .	neutral	1
4394	I see . And how about the working hours ?	neutral	2
4395	Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times .	neutral	1
4396	Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me .	neutral	1
4397	Good , as long as you understand that .	neutral	1
4398	And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ?	neutral	2
4399	Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month .	happiness	3
4400	That sounds ideal .	happiness	4
4401	Smells good ! What ’ s for breakfast ?	happiness	2
4402	Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast !	happiness	1
4403	Nice ! Brunch !	happiness	1
4404	Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !	happiness	1
4405	Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?	happiness	2
4406	Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .	happiness	1
4407	Looks good ! I ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .	happiness	3
4408	Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ’ t forget the syrup !	happiness	4
4409	Come on , fellows . Let's enjoy my wife's cooking !	happiness	3
4410	Em , it's delicious !	happiness	4
4411	Thank you ! My wife likes cooking very much .	happiness	1
4412	You're lucky .	happiness	1

4434	Excuse me , I'd like to have these pants I bought here yesterday altered . Here's my receipt .	neutral	3
4435	Certainly , sir . What would you like done to them ?	neutral	2
4436	They're a little bit too long , so I'd like about half an inch taken off them .	neutral	1
4437	All right , sir . They should be ready for you by tomorrow afternoon .	neutral	4
4438	Thank you very much .	happiness	1
4439	It's our pleasure .	happiness	1

4457	No . She is actually very intelligent and well behaved .	happiness	1
4458	I'm glad to know that you like her .	happiness	1
4459	You have nothing to worry about with her .	happiness	1
4460	Good afternoon , ladies . May I help you ?	neutral	2
4461	Can we have two adjoining double rooms , sir ?	neutral	3
4462	Have you made a reservation , ladies ?	neutral	2

4464	One moment , please . I have to check if there are rooms available . I'm sorry , ladies . We have only two double rooms available but they are on different floors . Would you mind that ?	neutral	3

4612	David , how is your interview ?	neutral	2
4613	I was nervous at that time . What about you ?	neutral	2
4614	Just fine . I tried to answer every question raised by HR carefully . I found some answering skills are useful . These questions are different from exams .	neutral	1
4615	We can have a rest now after this tough interview .	neutral	3
4616	Don't be rush . It is suggested to write a letter for the Personnel Department of Future Clothes Company .	neutral	3
4617	Sounds like a good idea . And I think this can leave deep impression to HR . How can we write a suitable letter ?	neutral	2
4618	Just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company . And you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you .	neutral	3

4627	What time would you prefer ?	neutral	2
4628	I would prefer three o ’ clock in the afternoon .	neutral	3
4629	I will put you down for that time . Thank you for calling to reschedule .	neutral	3
4630	Can I help you ?	neutral	2
4631	En , I am looking for a porter , do you know where I can find one ?	neutral	2
4632	There are so many here.The men with red hats are the porters .	neutral	1
4633	What's the charge ?	neutral	2
4634	Well , it depends how many pieces of luggages you have .	neutral	1
4635	Thank you .	happiness	1
4636	Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ?	neutral	2
4637	Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers .	neutral	1
4638	Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ?	neutral	2
4639	Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion .	neutral	1
4640	I didn ’ t pay attention to that .	neutral	1
4641	Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ?	neutral	2
4642	It's a difficult choice.The train is a little faster , but much more expensive .	neutral	1
4643	We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams .	neutral	1
4644	Buses are more cramps and you can't walk around .	neutral	1
4645	That's true.But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus .	neutral	1
4646	Really ? I think you see more traveling by train .	surprise	1
4647	So which form of transport do you prefer to use ?	neutral	2
4648	I prefer going by train , even though it costs more .	neutral	1
4649	Ok , then we'll go by train . I'm sure we'll have a good journey.Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ?	neutral	3
4650	The trains aren't usually full.We can get them on the day we travel.We should buy return tickets , because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles .	neutral	4
4651	We should take a packed lunch on the journey.The food they sell on the trains is always expensive .	neutral	3
4652	Did you hear about Lulu ?	neutral	2
4653	No , what ?	neutral	1
4654	She and Vic broke up and now she ’ s asked for a transfer .	neutral	1
4655	Get out of here ! I didn ’ t even know they were dating !	surprise	1
4656	No one really did . They were very discreet and professional at the office .	neutral	1
4657	Here's a model of our latest design . What do you think of it ?	neutral	2
4658	Well , I'm not too happy about it .	neutral	1
4659	What's wrong with it ?	neutral	2
4660	Well , I'm afraid it's not at all what I wanted . You haven't really followed my instructions.It ' ll have to be done again .	neutral	3
4661	Oh , dear !	surprise	4
4662	Hello , this is the International Youth Hotel . How can I help you ?	neutral	2

4668	there's free Internet access in the lobby .	neutral	1
4669	is it available in the rooms ?	neutral	2
4670	Unfortunately not .	neutral	1
4671	that's OK . Is breakfast included ?	neutral	2
4672	yes , breakfast is included and parking is available .	neutral	1
4673	fantastic . Thank you very much .	neutral	1
4674	you're welcome . And we have 24 hour reception . Please don't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions .	neutral	1
4675	I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted .	neutral	1
4676	You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard .	neutral	3
4677	You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation .	sadness	3
4678	What sort of shopping is nearby , Mr . Taylor ?	neutral	2
4679	Call me John . This is a great area of the city for shopping . There ’ s a grocery store just around the corner .	neutral	1
4680	What about things other than food ?	neutral	2
4681	Well , the Riverside Mall has 200 stores in it , including four major department stores .	neutral	1
4682	Are there small shops near here as well ?	neutral	2
4683	Yes , on 4th street , near the movie theater there are many specialty shops , including clothing boutiques .	neutral	1
4684	Well , that sounds just wonderful .	happiness	1
4685	Yes , it ’ s a really nice neighborhood .	happiness	1
4686	Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it .	neutral	3
4687	Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know.Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more .	neutral	4
4688	But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished .	neutral	3
4689	But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely .	neutral	3
4690	Well , only you liked it really , darling .	neutral	4
4691	Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy .	neutral	3
4692	Hi , Bob , everything okay ?	neutral	2
4693	More or less . There's just one thing bothering me .	neutral	1
4694	Oh ? What's that ?	surprise	2
4695	Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .	neutral	1
4696	What gift ?	neutral	2
4697	It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it .	neutral	1
4698	You refused the gift ? That's terrible .	surprise	2
4699	I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way .	neutral	1
4700	Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .	neutral	1
4701	That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .	neutral	1
4702	I've been looking for a swimming pool , but I haven't found one yet .	neutral	3
4703	We have no pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in our gym .	neutral	1
4704	Swim stations ? Could you be a little more explicit ?	neutral	3
4705	You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere ? Well , it's the same thing .	neutral	1
4706	Gee , that's a great idea . Now , how much do I have to pay ?	neutral	2
4707	The stations are absolutely free to guests , sir .	neutral	1
4708	Great ! Now , when can I go down there and use the stations ?	neutral	2
4709	The swim stations are open daily from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m .	neutral	1
4710	Boy , oh boy ! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks .	happiness	1
4711	Be warned , sir . At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded .	neutral	3

4717	Myself .	neutral	1

4729	We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home .	neutral	1
4730	Do you need to be located in a particular school district ?	neutral	2
4731	It doesn ’ t matter , as we do not have any children .	neutral	1
4732	Is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ?	neutral	2
4733	In a perfect world , we would like a home with a view of the lake .	neutral	1
4734	Thank you for all of the information . I will help you find the perfect house for you .	happiness	4

4768	I can only offer you 110,000 Yuan a year . Raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . Is that satisfactory ?	neutral	3
4769	Yes , it is quite reasonable .	neutral	4

4802	Well , it's small , but it's a young , dynamic , rapidly-growing company with a progressive , humanistic philosophy .	neutral	1
4803	You didn't read their brochure or anything , did you ?	neutral	2
4804	Four times . I'm totally prepared . Oh , no ! I forgot to take off my nail polish ! And I have to be there in 15 minutes ! That's it . I blew it .	sadness	1

4819	The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice .	neutral	1
4820	What's next ?	neutral	2
4821	Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it .	neutral	1
4822	What's the next thing I need to do ?	neutral	2
4823	Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy .	neutral	1

4851	I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it .	neutral	1
4852	Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ?	neutral	2
4853	No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it !	surprise	1
4854	You said you received your card this morning , am I right ?	neutral	2
4855	Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ?	neutral	2
4856	Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons .	neutral	3
4857	Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me .	happiness	1
4858	Can you manage chopsticks ?	neutral	2
4859	Why not ? See .	neutral	1
4860	Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ?	happiness	2
4861	Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG .	happiness	1
4862	What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food .	surprise	2
4863	According to some studies it may cause cancer .	neutral	1
4864	Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population .	neutral	1
4865	I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated .	neutral	2
4866	I don't know exactly . It's a tradition . Maybe it's for sanitary reasons .	neutral	1
4867	Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ?	neutral	2
4868	It was a nightmare .	sadness	1
4869	What ’ s up ?	neutral	2
4870	Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .	neutral	1
4871	Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?	neutral	2
4872	Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .	sadness	1
4873	This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ?	neutral	2
4874	I am still waiting for their call .	sadness	1
4875	Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward .	neutral	1
4876	Do you have any seat preferences , sir ?	neutral	2
4877	Yes , could you put me in the no-smoking section ?	neutral	3
4878	Yes . Would you like a window seat ?	neutral	3
4879	If one's available , please . But not over the wing .	neutral	4
4880	morning . Rent-A-Car Agency . May I help you ?	neutral	2
4881	Good morning . This is Paul Alexander calling from the Isis Advertising Firm . We need a car to the airport for Mr . Phillips .	neutral	3
4882	Certainly , Mr . Alexander . When would Mr . Phillips like to leave ?	neutral	2
4883	Let me check ... His flight ’ s at 2:30 p . m . , so he should leave no later than 12 noon .	neutral	3
4884	I'm calling today about a bill that I never received .	neutral	1
4885	Can you tell me which credit card it was for ?	neutral	3
4886	It was for my Master Card .	neutral	1
4887	You should've gotten that bill two weeks ago .	neutral	1
4888	I haven't got it in the mail yet .	neutral	1
4889	The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed .	neutral	1
4890	What am I supposed to do about my bill then ?	neutral	2
4891	Maybe you should call your post office .	neutral	3
4892	But if it's their mistake , can I get an extension on my bill payment ?	neutral	2
4893	Yes , but you will need to send us proof of their mistake .	neutral	3
4894	Okay , thank you very much for your help .	neutral	4
4895	Not a problem . Enjoy the rest of your day .	neutral	1
4896	Jenny , don't you think it's really charming ?	neutral	2
4897	Yes . It's a feast of eyes to walking in the museum .	neutral	1
4898	Let's take our time and enjoy the art and sprite of the famous museum .	neutral	3
4899	What a shame that we can't take pictures .	neutral	1
4900	OK , Allen . It's your turn . Are you ready ?	neutral	2
4901	I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ?	neutral	2
4902	Come on ! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song !	anger	1
4903	I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night .	neutral	1
4904	"Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him . He loves "" The King . """	neutral	2
4905	I'll put the song at the front of the list .	neutral	1
4906	Here is the document you asked for this morning .	neutral	1
4907	Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks .	happiness	1
4908	You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later .	neutral	1
4909	This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ?	happiness	2
4910	The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .	neutral	1
4911	Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do .	happiness	1
4912	How are you doing , Jim ?	neutral	2
4913	Fine , just fine.How about you ?	neutral	2
4914	Not too bad .	neutral	1
4915	I think your presentation impressed the client , Daniel . You did a good job .	happiness	1
4916	Thank you , Mr . Cooper . I hope we get the contract .	happiness	1
4917	What's for lunch ?	neutral	2
4918	Pork chops .	neutral	1
4919	What happened to you ?	neutral	2
4920	I think I caught a cold .	neutral	1
4921	Do you have any symptoms ?	neutral	2
4922	Runny nose and coughing .	neutral	1
4923	Do you have a fever ?	neutral	2
4924	I have just taken the temperature , I don't think so .	neutral	1
4925	It's not serious .	neutral	1
4926	Are you sure ?	neutral	2
4927	Yes .	neutral	1
4928	What should I do ?	neutral	2
4929	You should drink more hot water , and do some exercise .	neutral	3
4930	What kind of place shall we rent ?	neutral	2
4931	It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .	neutral	1
4932	Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .	neutral	1
4933	Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area .	neutral	1
4934	I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .	neutral	1
4935	Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .	happiness	3
4936	Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .	neutral	4
4937	How much do you think the rent will be ?	neutral	2
4938	I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .	neutral	1
4939	I don't think we can meet the delivery date you suggest . It's too soon .	neutral	4
4940	Well , is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of June ?	neutral	2
4941	The earliest we can do is by the end of June .	neutral	1
4942	Did you have any working experience during college ?	neutral	2
4943	Yes , I did some part-time jobs such as English tutor , salesman , and model .	neutral	1
4944	What did you learn from your part-time jobs ?	neutral	2
4945	I learned to be patient , professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .	neutral	1
4946	Smells good ! What ’ s for breakfast ?	happiness	2
4947	Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast !	happiness	1
4948	Nice ! Brunch !	happiness	1
4949	Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !	happiness	1
4950	Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?	happiness	2
4951	Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .	neutral	1
4952	Looks good ! I ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .	happiness	1
4953	Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ’ t forget the syrup !	neutral	3
4954	Can you tell me if there is a flight to New York ?	neutral	3
4955	Yes . Flight DB117 departs at 5:38 pm and arrives in New York at 6:00 am with a layover in Chicago . It also makes a refueling stop at Colombia .	neutral	4
4956	So many stops ! Don't you have any direct flights ?	neutral	2
4957	Sorry sir , it is the only flight wa have right now .	neutral	1
4958	Hello.Hot water overflowed from the bathtub.Will you help me ?	neutral	3
4959	Would you turn off the tap ?	neutral	3
4960	I did it .	neutral	4
4961	Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door ?	neutral	3
4962	OK . I will .	neutral	4
4963	I'll have our housekeeper come right away .	neutral	3
4964	I'm sorry I was too tired to fall asleep .	neutral	4
4965	When you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub .	neutral	1
4966	Right.Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ?	neutral	2
4967	Would you like some more coffee ?	neutral	3
4968	No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .	neutral	4
4969	The waitress is bringing the bill right now .	neutral	1
4970	This waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ?	neutral	2
4971	Yes , this waitress did a great job .	neutral	1
4972	OK , let's see what the damage is . The total for our meal is $ 36.00 .	neutral	1
4973	What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ?	neutral	2
4974	Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ?	neutral	2
4975	Yes , 20 % would be perfect .	neutral	1
4976	Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . The total will be $ 43.20 .	neutral	1
4977	Yes , that was one fantastic meal !	happiness	1
4978	I agree . Maybe we can come back again next week .	happiness	1
4979	It ’ s time for me to go now .	neutral	1
4980	Would you like me to go with you ?	neutral	3
4981	I ’ d rather you stayed in the office and did these things .	neutral	3
4982	Do you want to type that letter ?	neutral	2
4983	I ’ d rather you typed it .	neutral	3
4984	Do you want to tell her ?	neutral	2
4985	I ’ d rather you told her .	neutral	3
4986	Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head .	neutral	3
4987	What crime did I commit ?	neutral	2
4988	You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs , so we are taking you into custody . We ’ Ve found some heroin in your house . You have the following rights while you are being interviewed . You have the right to remain silent . You don't have to make any statement against your will . You have the right to defense counsel . You have the right to request an investigation of evidence favorable to your case . Do you understand your rights ?	neutral	3
4989	I am innocent .	neutral	4
4990	Would you like to come by and play bridge ?	neutral	3
4991	Well , let's see . Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time .	neutral	3
4992	Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired .	neutral	4
4993	Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies .	neutral	3
4994	Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ?	neutral	3
4995	Well , do you have any suggestions ?	neutral	2
4996	Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ?	neutral	2
4997	It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .	neutral	1
4998	Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff .	neutral	3
4999	OK .	neutral	4
5000	Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ?	neutral	3
5001	Tom , it's time for you to go to bed .	neutral	3
5002	Good night , mum .	neutral	4
5003	Good night .	neutral	1
5004	Operator . May I help you ?	neutral	2
5005	Yes . How do I get an outside line , please ?	neutral	3
5006	Just dial 0 , wait for the dial tone , and then dial the phone number you want to call . Or we can place a call for you , if you want .	neutral	3
5007	No , thanks a lot . I'll try it myself .	happiness	4
5008	What's our target audience for this campaign ?	neutral	2
5009	This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two .	neutral	1
5010	Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ?	neutral	2
5011	Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here .	neutral	1
5012	Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ?	neutral	2
5013	Demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year .	neutral	1
5014	John , I'd like to see you in my office for a minute .	neutral	3
5015	Yes , sir , I'll be there in just a moment .	neutral	4
5016	John , I have been watching you . I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed . You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . I just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , I'm recommending you for promotion .	neutral	3
5017	Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department .	happiness	4
5018	Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it .	neutral	3
5019	Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff .	surprise	4
5020	You've earned it .	neutral	1
5021	How can I help you today ?	neutral	2
5022	I am returning something that I bought yesterday .	neutral	3
5023	What would you like to return ?	neutral	2
5024	I'm returning a cellphone .	neutral	1
5025	Was there something wrong with it ?	neutral	2
5026	It's defective .	neutral	1
5027	What isn't working on it ?	neutral	2
5028	It keeps turning off on it's own .	neutral	1
5029	Alright , do you have the receipt ?	neutral	2
5030	I have it right here .	neutral	1
5031	I'm going to take care of this and refund your money .	neutral	4
5032	Thanks for your help .	happiness	1
5033	I miss grandma . I dreamed about her yesterday .	sadness	1
5034	Dear , let ’ s drop the subject .	neutral	3
5035	Good morning , sir . Can I help you ?	neutral	2
5036	Good morning . I'd like to cash this check .	neutral	3
5037	Yes , sir . Can you show you identity ?	neutral	3
5038	What about the driving license ?	neutral	3
5039	Don't you have any other identification ?	neutral	2
5040	I am sorry . I only have my driving license with me .	neutral	1
5041	Ok . Would you please sign your name on the back of the check ?	neutral	3
5042	Thank you . Here you are .	neutral	4
5043	How do you want your money ?	neutral	2
5044	Would you give me some in twenties and tens ?	neutral	3
5045	All right . Please wait for a moment .	neutral	4
5046	Could you fill in this form , please ?	neutral	2
5047	All right .	neutral	3
5048	Have you got any identification ?	neutral	3
5049	Yes , here's my ID card .	neutral	4
5050	Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !	anger	1
5051	What ? What did you buy ?	neutral	2
5052	It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !	anger	1
5053	What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?	neutral	2
5054	There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick .	neutral	1
5055	And ?	neutral	2
5056	So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .	neutral	1
5057	And it's a brick ?	neutral	2
5058	Yes .	neutral	1
5059	I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?	neutral	2
5060	I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .	neutral	1
5061	So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .	neutral	1
5062	Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .	neutral	1
5063	But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?	neutral	2
5064	He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .	neutral	1
5065	Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !	neutral	1
5066	C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .	neutral	1
5067	That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .	neutral	1
5068	You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?	neutral	2
5069	Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ?	neutral	2
5070	Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ’ m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision .	neutral	3
5071	Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then , cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you .	neutral	3
5072	Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign .	neutral	1
5073	Wow , Arthur ! You ’ re as blind as a bat !	surprise	1
5074	Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times .	sadness	1
5075	Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription .	neutral	3
5076	Thanks doc !	neutral	4
5077	Arthur , that ’ s the bathroom .	neutral	3
5078	Would you like some more coffee ?	neutral	3
5079	No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .	neutral	4
5080	Good luck finding the waitress !	neutral	1
5081	The service this evening has kind of sucked . Is that our server over there ?	neutral	3
5082	I'll go get the check , since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way .	neutral	4
5083	Good . I'll just stay here until you get back .	neutral	3
5084	So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner .	neutral	4
5085	How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ?	neutral	2
5086	I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service .	neutral	1
5087	I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight .	neutral	1
5088	I think that we should leave 10 % .	neutral	3
5089	$ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip .	neutral	4
5090	I want to fly to Congo on Monday , the 17th .	neutral	3
5091	Let me see what's available .	neutral	1
5092	By the way , I'd prefer a night flight .	neutral	3

5094	That's fine . I want to pay in cash . Here is the money .	neutral	1
5095	How much was your watch ?	neutral	2
5096	Take a guess .	neutral	1
5097	A guy in my office got the flu the other day . Today I seem to have come down with it , too .	sadness	1
5098	Very likely . You have a slight fever . Do you have a headache , too ?	neutral	2
5099	Yes . I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because I'll be on a business trip in two days .	neutral	3
5100	Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery .	neutral	3
5101	But I'm going on a business trip in two days !	surprise	4
5102	Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others .	neutral	3
5103	Would you care for a drink ?	neutral	3
5104	No , thanks . I'm fine .	neutral	4
5105	Let's go practice your driving .	neutral	3
5106	If that's what you want to do , then we can .	neutral	4
5107	Did you buckle your seatbelt ?	neutral	2
5108	I'm buckled up . What's next ?	neutral	2
5109	You need to start the car now .	neutral	1
5110	What do you want me to do ?	neutral	2
5111	Go left .	neutral	1
5112	How far should I go ?	neutral	2
5113	I'll let you know when I want you to stop .	neutral	1
5114	Tell me before you want me to stop .	neutral	3
5115	All right , try parking here .	neutral	4
5116	Thanks . Let's go driving again tomorrow .	happiness	3
5117	How may I help you ?	neutral	2
5118	I ’ m making a deposit today .	neutral	3
5119	Cash or check ?	neutral	2
5120	I would like to deposit a check .	neutral	3
5121	You need to sign the back .	neutral	3
5122	Okay . Here you go .	neutral	4
5123	Would you like cash back ?	neutral	3
5124	Yes , I would .	neutral	4
5125	How much ?	neutral	2
5126	Let me get $ 150 back .	neutral	3
5127	Here you go .	neutral	4
5128	Thank you . Have a good one .	happiness	1
5129	I'd like to extend my visa for another two years .	neutral	3
5130	Are you on a tourist visa or a student visa ?	neutral	2
5131	Student visa .	neutral	1

5138	I do have one problem with the apartment .	neutral	1
5139	What ’ s the problem ?	neutral	2
5140	I don ’ t like all those stains in the carpet .	neutral	1
5141	We will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment .	neutral	1
5142	I did not know that .	neutral	1
5143	I assure you that we will , and if there are any more problems , feel free to tell me .	neutral	1
5144	That was the only thing that I saw wrong with the apartment .	neutral	1
5145	I ’ m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice .	happiness	1
5146	It ’ s absolutely incredible . I ’ ll take it .	happiness	1
5147	Come in , Arnold . Have a seat .	neutral	3
5148	Good morning .	neutral	1
5149	Would you like something to drink ?	neutral	3
5150	No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk .	neutral	4
5151	So , you're a serious coffee drinker .	neutral	1
5152	Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted .	neutral	1
5153	Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ?	neutral	2
5154	No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker .	neutral	1
5155	Well , what would you like to talk to me about ?	neutral	3
5156	I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .	neutral	3
5157	I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it .	neutral	3
5158	It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday .	neutral	1
5159	Yes .	neutral	1
5160	Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here .	neutral	3
5161	What do you suggest ?	neutral	2
5162	The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation .	neutral	3
5163	You mean because people have to go across town to get here .	neutral	1
5164	Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road .	neutral	1
5165	That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them .	neutral	1
5166	I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them .	neutral	1
5167	I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that .	neutral	1
5168	Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more .	neutral	3
5169	Well .	neutral	4
5170	I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that .	neutral	3
5171	You mean you want to run the meetings ?	neutral	2
5172	No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .	neutral	3
5173	Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks .	neutral	4
5174	I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized .	neutral	3
5175	I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .	neutral	4
5176	Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it .	happiness	1
5177	"I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this "" new style . """	neutral	1
5178	Do you have a good English-Chinese dictionary ?	neutral	2
5179	Sure . How about this one ?	neutral	3
5180	Is this the latest edition ?	neutral	2
5181	Yes . We have both the paperback and the hardcover .	neutral	1
5182	What's the difference ?	neutral	2
5183	The hardcover is more expensive .	neutral	1
5184	Oh ! I see . I'll have the paperback , please .	happiness	4
5185	Oriental China Airlines . Good morning , may I help you ?	neutral	2
5186	I would like the round-way ticket to Shanghai on December 10th .	neutral	3
5187	Lady , let me check . Do you want the morning or the afternoon flight ?	neutral	2
5188	What's the departure time ?	neutral	2
5189	2:30	neutral	1
5190	Well , the afternoon will be fine .	neutral	3
5191	First class or economy ?	neutral	2
5192	First class will be preferred .	neutral	3
5193	Well , afternoon flight on December 10th to Shanghai . May I have your name , please ?	neutral	2
5194	My name is Janice . Well , I book this ticket for Nova , the marketing manager of Pineapple Computer Company . Where can I get the flight ticket ?	neutral	2
5195	You may take it up at the ticket office . That is located on International Street 150 .	neutral	1
5196	Where are you feeling the pain ?	neutral	2
5197	I can ’ t stand up ! My stomach is killing me !	neutral	1
5198	Can you put your hand where it hurts the most ?	neutral	3
5199	It hurts smack in the middle of my gut !	neutral	3
5200	Did this just come on suddenly ?	neutral	2
5201	I felt OK until an hour or so ago , and then I just doubled over .	neutral	1
5202	Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently ?	neutral	2
5203	No , and I don ’ t usually get a lot of stomachaches .	neutral	1
5204	We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is .	neutral	3
5205	I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this . Thank you .	neutral	4
5206	May I help you ?	neutral	2
5207	Yes , I would like to exchange some money .	neutral	3
5208	what currency would you like to trade in ?	neutral	2
5209	I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars . Do you accept $ 100 bills ?	neutral	3
5210	No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ?	neutral	2
5211	Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ?	neutral	2
5212	It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7.45RMB.If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7.35.Will that be all right ?	neutral	1
5213	I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow !	neutral	3
5214	Has your son started school yet , Tom ?	neutral	2
5215	Next week , it ’ s going to be quite a shock for him !	neutral	1
5216	He ’ ll get used to it . They always do . I still remember when my daughter started . Are you going with him on his first day ?	neutral	2
5217	You bet . I wouldn ’ t miss it !	happiness	1
5218	May I speak to Mr.Huang , please ?	neutral	3
5219	I'm sorry . Mr.Huang is quite busy right now . Could I pass him the message ?	neutral	3
5220	Well , you see , I won't be able to keep my 9	neutral	1
5221	Let me see . He's free from 3:00 to 4:30 tomorrow afternoon . Can you make it then ?	neutral	3
5222	Yes , of course . Thank you very much .	happiness	4
5223	You're quite welcome . Thank you for calling . Bye-byeB	happiness	1
5224	Dad , hurry ! The train is coming . Aha , I am a superman .	neutral	3
5225	Don't rush , behave yourself please ! Let the people get off first .	neutral	4
5226	Oh , we should . There are so many people . What if the train got full before we could get in ?	neutral	2
5227	But , if we all pushed our way in , nobody could get off , and nobody could get in either .	neutral	1
5228	How many stops are there to the Aidan station ?	neutral	2
5229	There are four more stops .	neutral	1
5230	Oh , my God !	surprise	1
5231	What's wrong ? You are like a little monkey , on pins and needles !	neutral	2
5232	Because I need to use the restroom . Is there a restroom on the train ?	neutral	2
5233	No , not on the train , but in the station .	neutral	1
5234	Why not ? You told me that subway is a kind of train . If it had no restroom . what kind of train would that be ?	neutral	2
5235	Well , that is a question . You want to offer a suggestion ?	neutral	2
5236	Oh , yeah , but not today . I am busy with praying the subway may get there as fast as possible .	neutral	1
5237	I guess you'll never forget today .	neutral	1
5238	This broth is wonderful . What's in it ?	happiness	2
5239	Lamb and beef . It will get even tastier when we add the veggies !	happiness	1
5240	Hey ! Watch out ! You're using the same spoon for both broths !	neutral	3
5241	So ?	surprise	2
5242	You're getting that hot stuff in my mild broth !	neutral	1

5248	You'll have to make an appointment .	neutral	3
5249	What do I need to make an appointment for ?	neutral	2
5250	You need an appointment so you can sign the papers .	neutral	1
5251	All right , can I make an appointment right now ?	neutral	3
5252	When are you available ?	neutral	2
5253	Can I make it for tomorrow at 9	neutral	3

5272	That was nice and fast . Thanks .	happiness	1
5273	Not at all .	happiness	1
5274	I'm about to run out of business cards . I need some new ones .	neutral	3
5275	We can print as many as you like . Just tell me how many .	neutral	3
5276	Two thousand should get me through the year .	neutral	4
5277	Here's a form to get you started .	neutral	3
5278	My old card is perfect , so all I want you to do is copy it exactly .	neutral	3
5279	I think you'll be very pleased with how well we duplicate your old card .	neutral	4
5280	... Here you go	neutral	4
5281	Thanks . Come back here next Wednesday to pick up your order , please .	happiness	3
5282	I'm sorry , but can you give me a three-day turnaround ?	neutral	3
5283	If you don't mind paying a little extra , it's absolutely no problem .	neutral	4
5284	Lisa , is there a milk section ?	neutral	2
5285	No , there's no such section . The dairy section is where you'll find milk and cheese .	neutral	1
5286	What's Condiments ?	neutral	2
5287	That's where you'll find things like salt and pepper .	neutral	1
5288	Oh , I see .	neutral	1
5289	Let's go to aisle 4 to pick up some pasta for tonight .	neutral	3
5290	Great ! Pasta for dinner .	happiness	4
5291	And let's get a loaf of bread at the bakery for breakfast .	neutral	3
5292	Maybe we should get a shopping cart .	neutral	3
5293	I'll put the shopping basket back .	neutral	4
5294	Did you lock the doors ?	neutral	2
5295	All except the back door . I left that open for Tim . He took the dog for a walk .	neutral	1
5296	Well , I'm going on to bed . I'm beat .	neutral	1
5297	Okay . I'm going to stay up a while . I've got to go over the household budget . We're a little overspent this month .	neutral	1
5298	Please tell Tim to close the door to the basement . I don't want the dog down there tonight .	neutral	3
5299	Okay . Good night . See you at breakfast .	neutral	4
5300	Well , I'm glad you're finally back . I was wondering what happened .	happiness	1
5301	I feel kind of stupid .	neutral	1
5302	Why ?	neutral	2
5303	We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet .	neutral	1
5304	You got lost . You're kidding !	surprise	1
5305	No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .	neutral	1
5306	You could have called .	neutral	1
5307	I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were .	neutral	1
5308	You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ?	surprise	2
5309	Guess where we ended up .	neutral	1
5310	I don't know . Where ?	neutral	2
5311	When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield .	neutral	1
5312	Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ?	surprise	2
5313	I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .	neutral	1
5314	Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .	neutral	1
5315	I know it is . I don't know how it happened .	neutral	1
5316	Hmm , maybe I do .	neutral	1
5317	What ?	neutral	2
5318	Maybe I have an idea how it happened .	neutral	1
5319	How ?	neutral	2
5320	You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road .	neutral	1
5321	Oh , that's what you think , huh ?	neutral	2
5322	Won't you have some of this ?	neutral	3
5323	Yes , thanks .	happiness	4
5324	It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue .	neutral	1
5325	It's very good . How do you make it ?	happiness	2
5326	I use a special dressing and homemade catsup .	neutral	1
5327	This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day .	happiness	1
5328	I'm glad you like it .	happiness	1
5329	You Americans usually have nutritious food .	neutral	1
5330	Oh , but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ?	happiness	2
5331	We use different spices but few people use recipes . They learn to cook by experience .	neutral	1
5332	I always use a recipe but my grandmother never did . She was a great cook . She would make clam chowder and cornbread every Sunday night .	neutral	1
5333	I like these shoes .	neutral	1
5334	Do you realize that all these shoes are half off ?	neutral	2
5335	Really ?	surprise	2
5336	Yes , but the offer only lasts this week .	neutral	1
5337	Do you have experience in advertising ?	neutral	2
5338	Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company .	neutral	1
5339	What were you mean duties there ?	neutral	2
5340	I mostly did advertising planning .	neutral	1
5341	What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?	neutral	2
5342	I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .	neutral	1
5343	What was the most important thing you have learned at work ?	neutral	2
5344	The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact in success . If I want to make in marking in advertising history , I can ’ t stop studying and creating .	neutral	1
5345	Dad , may I have a room of my own ?	neutral	3
5346	Oh , honey , I'm so sorry , we don't have enough space for you to have your own room .	neutral	4
5347	Dad , but I don't want to share a room with Peter . He snores every night .	sadness	1
5348	Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ?	neutral	3
5349	Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it .	neutral	4
5350	Come in and sit down , Jack . Now , what's the trouble ?	neutral	2
5351	I've got a terrible pain in my stomach , Doctor .	neutral	1
5352	I see . When did it start ?	neutral	2
5353	It started yesterday . I didn't eat any supper .	neutral	1
5354	Have you got a temperature ?	neutral	2
5355	I think so . I feel very hot .	neutral	1
5356	Let's see . Yes . You ' Ve got quite a high temperature .	neutral	1
5357	I've got an awful headache , too , and my throat hurts .	neutral	1
5358	Hm ... I think you ' Ve got the flu .	neutral	1
5359	Is it serious ?	neutral	2
5360	No , not at all , but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine .	neutral	3
5361	How often must I take it ?	neutral	2
5362	Three times a day after meals .	neutral	3
5363	Thank you , Doctor.Goodbye .	neutral	4
5364	Our usual supplier has let us down and I ’ Ve been looking through your parts catalogue . I need fifty GT670s . How soon can you deliver ?	neutral	2
5365	Just a moment and I'll check . We ’ re expecting a delivery on Friday . We've only got ten in stock at the moment . I can deliver those by first thing tomorrow morning . There'll be an extra charge for special delivery . I'll have to send them by courier .	neutral	3
5366	Why don ’ t you sit down and relax , darling ?	neutral	2
5367	I don ’ t want to .	neutral	1
5368	Well , come and talk to me then .	neutral	3
5369	Certainly not .	neutral	4
5370	May I turn on the radio then ?	neutral	3
5371	Turn on the radio ? What for ?	surprise	2
5372	So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .	neutral	1
5373	Listen to some music ? And who ’ ll cook dinner ? Will you ?	neutral	2
5374	Ok , I will . But let ’ s go to a disco after dinner .	neutral	3
5375	To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop .	neutral	4
5376	Good afternoon , ma'am . May I help you ?	neutral	2
5377	Yes . Can I deposit valuables here ?	neutral	3
5378	Of course , you can . Please put your articles in this bag and seal it .	neutral	3
5379	OK .	neutral	4
5380	Thank you . Here is your tag .	neutral	3
5381	Would you tell me the rate per day for depositing my bag ?	neutral	3
5382	Sure , madam . Only one dollar .	neutral	4
5383	When does the cloakroom close ?	neutral	2
5384	This cloakroom is open until 10 p . m .	neutral	1
5385	Oh , dear ! I won't be back until about 11:30 tonight . Where can I pick up my bag ?	neutral	2
5386	We will transfer your bag to the Lobby Floor Cloakroom . You may collect it there , madam .	neutral	3
5387	I see . Thanks a lot .	happiness	4
5388	You're welcome .	happiness	1
5389	Can you develop the roll of film ?	neutral	2
5390	Sure .	neutral	1
5391	How long does it take ?	neutral	2
5392	6 hours . If you are in a hurry we can develop it in 3 hours .	neutral	1
5393	There is no need . I will come back tomorrow .	neutral	1
5394	Good afternoon Miss , would you be interested in buying more life insurance ? You know , you can never get enough .	neutral	3
5395	I think my husband has some .	neutral	4
5396	Are you sure he ’ s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? If something terrible happened with your husband , and he doesn ’ t have sufficient insurance , my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you .	neutral	3
5397	That ’ s true . If something happened to my husband , I might lose everything . Both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ’ s education . I can ’ t afford that by myself .	neutral	4
5398	Could we sit and look at the policy I mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ?	neutral	3
5399	Certainly .	neutral	4
5400	The buildings are really magnificent .	happiness	1
5401	Yes , millions of travelers come here every year for the view of the buildings .	neutral	1
5402	The journey is worth while . Where are we going after this ?	neutral	2
5403	We will visit the Statue of Liberty as scheduled .	neutral	1
5404	Excuse me .	neutral	3
5405	Yes ?	neutral	2
5406	Do you have any information about the city sights ?	neutral	3
5407	Sure . There ’ s a lot here in this pamphlet .	neutral	4
5408	Thank you . And what ’ s the best way to get downtown ?	neutral	2
5409	Take the subway . It ’ s $ 1.50 per ride . You can buy a petrol card at the station .	neutral	3
5410	You ’ Ve been very helpful .	neutral	4
5411	My pleasure .	neutral	1
5412	I want to open a saving account , sir.What ' s the proper procedure ?	neutral	2
5413	First , you fill out the application form and then we'll issue you a passbook .	neutral	3
5414	Is there any minimum for the first deposit ?	neutral	2
5415	No , Even a dollar is all right.Here ' s your passbook , sir ; just sign your name on it .	neutral	3
5416	What is the annual interest rate ?	neutral	2
5417	It varies from time to time.At present it is 6 % .	neutral	1
5418	By the way , can I open a checking account too ?	neutral	3
5419	By all means.But you have to deposit enough money before you can write out your checks .	neutral	4
5420	You look depressed . What's on your mind ?	neutral	2
5421	Well , I had a blood test last week . The doctor said that I have high blood pressure and my blood is thick and sticky . I'm very worried .	sadness	1
5422	Take it easy . When we last talked , you promised there would be more exercises in your life . But now you are putting on some weight .	neutral	1
5423	I have to admit it's easier said than done .	neutral	1
5424	Well , I think it's time for you to change your eating habits and develop a healthy lifestyle . Regular exercise will improve your health .	neutral	3
5425	But you know I'm just not into exercises . And I wouldn't have time for exercises , either .	neutral	4
5426	You can do some jogging . It's easy and it doesn't take much time .	neutral	3
5427	Actually , my doctor said the same thing .	neutral	4
5428	Excuse me , sir , but you have to put your bags here before entering the market .	neutral	3
5429	Oh . I am sorry . I was busy looking for some whisky.Can you tell me the exactly place where I can find any ?	neutral	3
5430	Yes , it's on the third floor .	neutral	4
5431	Here ' s my passport . I'm a visiting scholar .	neutral	1
5432	Do you have anything to declare ?	neutral	2
5433	No , these are all my personal effects .	neutral	1
5434	What's in the bag ? Would you mind opening the bag ?	neutral	3
5435	Not at all . I don't know what's dutiable . Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use ?	neutral	2
5436	NO . You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings .	neutral	1
5437	Thank you .	neutral	1
5438	Do you work well under pressure ?	neutral	2
5439	Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ’ t mind working under pressure . I work well under that circumstance . People can , I can .	neutral	1
5440	Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?	neutral	2
5441	No , nothing in particular .	neutral	1
5442	How soon can you begin working for us ?	neutral	2
5443	I need about two to three weeks for necessary formalities . I will quit then transfer to your company .	neutral	1
5444	What do you want ?	neutral	2
5445	I think I have a piece of apple pie .	neutral	1
5446	Do you want something to drink ?	neutral	2
5447	Coffee would be fine .	neutral	1
5448	OK . Sit down and I'll get it .	neutral	3
5449	Our new production control program's going live on Monday . The old and the new programs will operate in tandem for four to six weeks . That should give us time to iron out any little problems .	neutral	1
5450	Hope it all goes well . We're very busy at the moment and certainly don't want any problems at this time of year .	neutral	1
5451	Yes , I realise that . We've spent a long time planning and preparing for the change-over . I'm confident we won't have any major problems .	neutral	1
5452	Who broke my chair ?	neutral	2

5478	All right . Have a seat , please . Let me ask you a few questions . First of all , may I have your name , please ?	neutral	3
5479	My name's Donald Eakins .	neutral	4
5480	How do you spell your last name , Mr.Eakins .	neutral	2
5481	It's E-A-K-I-N-S .	neutral	1
5482	E-A-K-I-N-S.First name , Donald . And what's your present address , Mr.Eakins ?	neutral	2
5483	It's 1446 Pine Street .	neutral	1
5484	1446 Pine . That's in San Francisco , isn't it ?	neutral	2
5485	Yes , it is .	neutral	1
5486	Did you check before you left the shop ?	neutral	2
5487	Yes , I did . But when I got home , my son put it on and we found the hole .	neutral	1
5488	Really ? Let me have a look at it . Mm . OK . Let me change it for another one .	neutral	1
5489	Thank you very much .	happiness	1
5490	I hate to do this , but I've got to cancel a reservation I made earlier this week .	neutral	3
5491	All I need is your name , phone , and reservation date .	neutral	3
5492	My name is Rudy Randolph . I'm at 818-555-1234 . The reservation was for April 9 .	neutral	1

5495	It's been my pleasure to help you .	fear	1
5496	Did you go and buy your bus pass ?	neutral	2
5497	No , I didn't .	neutral	1
5498	When are you going to go get it ?	neutral	2
5499	I'm not sure where they sell bus passes at .	neutral	1
5500	Why didn't you just ask me ?	neutral	2
5501	Where should I go ?	neutral	2
5502	You can get one from student services .	neutral	3
5503	I had no clue that I could get it there .	neutral	1
5504	I already knew that .	neutral	1
5505	Thanks for letting me know .	happiness	1
5506	You're welcome .	happiness	1
5507	I'm going to go and get it right now .	neutral	1
5508	Tomorrow is my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ?	neutral	2
5509	Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code .	neutral	3
5510	Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt .	neutral	1
5511	Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean .	neutral	3
5512	Excuse me . Will you please keep an eye on my suitcase ? I just want to make a phone call .	neutral	3
5513	Certainly , but will it take long ?	neutral	2

5516	Mike's Mechanics . Can I help you ?	neutral	2

5519	Thank you very much .	happiness	1
5520	Don't take too much off . I'm trying to grow my hair longer .	neutral	3
5521	How about two inches ?	neutral	2
5522	That sounds perfect . Do you think I can get some highlights today , too ? I've always wanted red .	happiness	2
5523	I think that will over-process your hair , you should wait at least two weeks .	neutral	1
5524	All right . I'll just have the cut and perm today .	neutral	1
5525	Great . My assistant will wash your hair , and then I'll be back to help you .	happiness	3
5526	OK .	neutral	4
5527	Oh , damn . There ’ s another traffic jam on the highway .	anger	1
5528	How can there be a traffic jam on a 16 - lane highway every day ?	neutral	2
5529	There are just too many people , and too many cars .	neutral	1
5530	I wonder if there was an accident .	neutral	2
5531	No , they just said it too many people were trying to get off at the Capitol exits .	neutral	1
5532	Well , let ’ s put on some music . We ’ re going to be stuck in this for a while .	neutral	3
5533	All right , what do you want to listen to ?	neutral	2
5534	How about some Beatles ?	neutral	3
5535	Yeah , all right .	happiness	4
5536	Excuse me . Mr . Emory ?	neutral	2
5537	Yes , Ms . Rodriguez ? How can I help you ?	neutral	2
5538	I wanted to see if I could arrange a meeting with you to discuss recruitment .	neutral	3

5540	Who ate the cookies that were sitting here ?	neutral	2
5541	I did , Mom .	neutral	1
5542	Shame on you . I was saving them for your brother .	anger	1
5543	Hello . May I speak to Brian , please ?	neutral	3
5544	Sorry , you have the wrong number . There ’ s no Brian here .	sadness	4
5545	Is this 777-9345 ?	neutral	2
5546	No , it ’ s 777-9344 ?	neutral	1
5547	Oh , I ’ m so sorry .	sadness	1

5563	Oh , sorry . Cross my fingers .	neutral	4
5564	Come on , Mary . We have to do the laundry .	neutral	3
5565	Where are we going ?	neutral	2
5566	Down to the basement .	neutral	1
5567	Do you have a washer down there ?	neutral	2
5568	Yes . We have a dryer , too .	neutral	1
5569	That's so convenient . Where are the dirty clothes ?	neutral	2
5570	They are in the basement already .	neutral	1
5571	But I didn't see you carry them down .	neutral	1

5576	Great . I forgot to ask you , though . How long did you want the place ?	happiness	2
5577	Six months .	neutral	1
5578	Oh , well , that might be a problem . I usually only sign one year leases .	neutral	1
5579	Well , one year would be fine , too . I ’ m not planning on leaving the area anytime soon .	neutral	1
5580	Well , if it ’ s not a problem . Then here you go .	neutral	1
5581	Just let me look at it quickly .	neutral	3
5582	Of course .	happiness	4
5583	Looks like a standard lease .	neutral	1
5584	Yeah , and don ’ t worry about the security deposit . If everything ’ s all right when you move out , you ’ ll get it back .	neutral	1
5585	O . K . Great . Just sign and date it here ?	neutral	2
5586	Yes . Thanks . You can move your stuff in tomorrow .	happiness	1
5587	Wonderful .	happiness	1

5589	Yes , the bookshop is just around the corner.Turn left and you ’ ll see the bookshop .	neutral	3
5590	Thank you very much.By the way , is the hospital beside the bookshop .	happiness	2
5591	Right , if you see the bookshop , you can see the hospital .	neutral	1
5592	Thank you for your help .	happiness	4

5607	We're supposed to be meeting alone .	neutral	4

5614	You mustn't pick it in this place .	neutral	3

5616	It's a private garden .	neutral	1
5617	You look fresh recently . And .. what's your weight now ?	neutral	2
5618	110 pounds .	neutral	1
5619	Really ? Congratulations ! That's really something beyond my imagination . How did you make it ? Did you keep on a diet ?	neutral	2
5620	No , you know I can't bear eating less .	neutral	1
5621	Then do the slim pills take effect on you ?	neutral	2
5622	I've quit it already . I go to aerobics class everyday instead .	neutral	1
5623	How's it going on ?	neutral	2
5624	You see . I've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite .	neutral	1
5625	I'd better exercise my body too . My limbs are rusty now .	neutral	1
5626	I don't think so . You look full of energy every day . Time has stood still with you .	neutral	1
5627	Thank you .	happiness	1
5628	Ahhs ! I'm beat !	neutral	1
5629	What happened to you ? You look like you got hit by a tornado !	surprise	2
5630	I just got back from fighting the crowds .	neutral	1
5631	You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ?	neutral	2
5632	Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ...	neutral	1
5633	Cool !	happiness	1
5634	Grabbing , pushing and shoving ...	neutral	1
5635	Thank god you are open ! I have an emergency !	happiness	1
5636	Hello , Mr . Henderson what can I do for you ?	neutral	2
5637	I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP !	neutral	3
5638	OK , I can have it ready by the end of the week .	neutral	4
5639	No , you don ’ t understand , I need this tomorrow morning ! I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ’ s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! She ’ s gonna kill me !	fear	3
5640	OK , I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon , but this suit is also very stained . I can ’ t guarantee we can remove it completely .	neutral	4
5641	Fine ! Can you also iron and starch this shirt ?	neutral	3
5642	Certainly .	happiness	4
5643	Great ! This is our secret ! If you see my wife , say nothing to her about this !	happiness	3
5644	How often does the bus run ?	neutral	2
5645	Every five minutes .	neutral	1
5646	Oh , here comes a bus !	neutral	1
5647	It comes on the dot .	neutral	1
5648	My warmest congratulations on your promotion !	happiness	1
5649	Thanks . It ’ s nothing special actually .	neutral	1
5650	Don ’ t say that . It owes to your efforts and team spirit .	neutral	1
5651	Oh , it was nothing . Anyone could have done it . I still have a lot to learn yet .	neutral	1
5652	You are very modest . Best luck in your new position .	happiness	1
5653	Thank you . I won ’ t let this promotion change me .	neutral	1
5654	Yes , emergency . There is a huge fire here .	fear	1
5655	Calm down , sir . What's your name and where are you now ?	neutral	2
5656	My name is Jerry and we are on the intersection of West Road and East Road .	neutral	1
5657	Sir , leave the house if the fire draws any closer to your house . Our men will be over in 5 minutes .	neutral	3
5658	Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ?	neutral	2
5659	Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it .	neutral	1
5660	Totally agree . What is your solution ?	neutral	2
5661	Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .	neutral	1
5662	You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .	neutral	1
5663	It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .	neutral	1
5664	But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .	neutral	1
5665	I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .	neutral	1
5666	Excuse me , is this the parcel counter ?	neutral	2
5667	Yes , what can I do for you ?	neutral	2
5668	I'd like to send this parcel , please .	neutral	3

5670	Some books and newspapers .	neutral	1
5671	OK . please fill in this form and label it .	neutral	3
5672	Is it all right ?	neutral	2
5673	Yeah . And would you like to mail it by air ?	neutral	2
5674	No , I'd rather send it by sea .	neutral	1
5675	Thirteen yuan , please . Here is the receipt and change .	neutral	3
5676	Thank you .	happiness	4
5677	You are welcome .	happiness	1
5678	But Ernie , we're still missing something . We need someone to play the music !	neutral	1
5679	Oh right ... you know , my friend Eric is a DJ . Maybe he would like to play with us .	neutral	3
5680	Hmm ... does he have a good ear for hip hop music ?	neutral	2
5681	Well , I don't know , but we can find out . We can talk to him and ask if he wants to join our group .	neutral	3
5682	Excuse me , is there any room available ? I want a single one .	neutral	3
5683	Yes . When do you want it ?	neutral	2
5684	Next Today . By the way , is there a closed circuit TV ?	neutral	2
5685	Yes , sir .	neutral	1
5686	What about laundry ?	neutral	2
5687	Sorry , sir . You have to pay by yourself .	neutral	1
5688	What time does the museum close ? Any idea ?	neutral	2
5689	I'm not sure , but I think It's open until 4 o'clock .	neutral	1
5690	What time is it now ?	neutral	2
5691	It's a quarter past three .	neutral	1
5692	I would like to buy some local handcrafts as gifts to my friends and relatives .	neutral	1
5693	There are many stores selling handcrafts in Paris . Our store is wellknown for vase , table wear and jewelry boxes . You can take your time and choose whatever you like .	neutral	1
5694	Well , the tapestry is delicate and beautiful .	happiness	1
5695	You have made an excellent choice , it is our newcomer . The tapestry is on hot sell with the design and quality . The design on it is traditional Paris architecture .	neutral	1
5696	How much is it ?	neutral	2
5697	100 frances .	neutral	1
5698	Mmm , it is reasonable . Look at this set of table wear , it is so beautiful !	happiness	1
5699	We have a piece of table clothing to go with it . It is a brocade one with pretty stars .	neutral	1
5700	This silver vase is a good ornament for the living room .	neutral	3
5701	You are right .	neutral	4
5702	I will take the tapestry , the set of table wear and the vase .	neutral	3
5703	OK . Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now .	neutral	3
5704	All right . I will take one .	happiness	4
5705	It's so boring .	neutral	1
5706	Don't you like it ?	neutral	2
5707	I don't . Is there anything worth watching on the other channel ?	neutral	2
5708	I think it's a basketball match on channel 5 .	neutral	1
5709	Do you mind if we switch over ?	neutral	3
5710	Well , I'd rather see a movie .	neutral	4
5711	What's the movie ?	neutral	2
5712	' Star war ' .	neutral	1
5713	It must be interesting .	happiness	1
5714	Yes , you're right .	happiness	1
5715	Where can I get my baggage ?	neutral	2
5716	Are you from a domestic flight or an international one ?	neutral	2
5717	An international one from Seattle .	neutral	1
5718	In that case , you should go to the baggage hall over there .	neutral	3
5719	Oh yes , I see the sign , thank you .	neutral	4
5720	Man ! That car almost hit me !	anger	1
5721	Yeah , that was close .	neutral	1
5722	Excuse me .	neutral	1
5723	Yes ?	neutral	2
5724	Could you tell me where the copy room is ?	neutral	3
5725	Sure . You just walk down this hallway . The copy room is the second room on the right .	neutral	4
5726	Doctor , save my baby , please	sadness	3
5727	What symptoms does he have ?	neutral	2
5728	He has had a fever for one day . Just now at home , he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up . We were at a loss what to do . We called an ambulance and brought the baby here .	neutral	1
5729	How long did the convulsion last ?	neutral	2
5730	About 3 minutes .	neutral	1
5731	Does he have any other complaints ?	neutral	2
5732	Three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . Yesterday , he began to have a fever .	neutral	1
5733	Have you taken his temperature ?	neutral	2
5734	It was 38 ° C this morning and it was 39 ° C just now .	neutral	1
5735	Let me examine him to see if there is any rash . No rash .	neutral	2
5736	Is it serious ? Is it meningitis ?	neutral	2
5737	No , it is not meningitis . Just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection .	neutral	1
5738	Does he have to be admitted to hospital ?	neutral	2
5739	No . No need for admission . I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . Then I will give you a prescription . The pink tablets are used for his fever . When his temperature is over 38 ° C , give him one tablet . The other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . The white liquid is for the cold . Give the baby plenty of water to drink .	neutral	3
5740	Thank you very much , doctor .	neutral	4
5741	Jack ! Do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ?	happiness	3
5742	Sure . I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies , not new pets !	happiness	4
5743	Well , this is my new baby . He ’ s just as much trouble . That ’ s for sure ! But , he ’ s a lot of fun !	happiness	1
5744	I see what you mean . He ’ s really cute . How old is he ?	neutral	2
5745	Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me ! I ’ Ve always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me ! Let ’ s get started !	happiness	3
5746	Ok , let ’ s start opening some presents !	happiness	4

5752	OK , that ’ s all of them . No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ?	neutral	2
5753	Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital !	fear	1
5754	Wow , this is amazing . I'm glad we've come here . So cool .	happiness	1
5755	I always love skiing . You know , it's a cool game for cool people . Stay with me and you will be cool , too .	happiness	3
5756	Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .	happiness	3
5757	Sure . It's probably the skiing show . Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .	neutral	4
5758	See that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .	neutral	3
5759	Hey , don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .	neutral	3
5760	You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ?	neutral	2
5761	They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .	neutral	1
5762	Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ?	neutral	2
5763	Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ?	surprise	2
5764	Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist .	neutral	1
5765	Sorry . Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .	neutral	1
5766	Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?	neutral	2
5767	It's possible . But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .	neutral	1
5768	It's a good thing . OK , let's go skiing .	happiness	3
5769	Here we go .	neutral	4

5854	Thank you .	neutral	1
5855	Now people are talking about world recession which started more than a year ago . Can you give us your personal assessment of the situation of the global economy ?	neutral	2
5856	As you know , we are in a very special time . This is a very hard time for many countries ' economics , both developed and developing . I think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies .	neutral	1
5857	What is the direct impact of the terrorist attack upon your country's economy ?	neutral	2
5858	Once the US economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack , the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world .	neutral	1
5859	What challenges is your country's economy facing at the moment ?	neutral	2
5860	We do face a lot of challenges because there is still much uncertainty about the world economy . It's very important for us to strike a proper balance between investment in fixed assets and household consumption .	neutral	1
5861	So , what do you plan to do today ?	neutral	2
5862	There is a Matisse exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art . Larry and I will go .	neutral	1

5866	Outside or inside ?	neutral	2
5867	Outside , on the sidewalk .	neutral	1
5868	Hmm . It's very cold today.But I brought my jacket . Maybe it will be alright to wait .	neutral	1
5869	The MYOMA is very popular . There will be a lot of people .	neutral	1
5870	MYOMA ? What's that ?	neutral	2
5871	Oh , sorry.It stands for the Museum of Modern Art . It's an acronym . M O M A MYOMA .	neutral	1
5872	I see . Do you have any suggestions for other things we should do ?	neutral	2
5873	I suggest you go to the Jewish Museum.It ' s not far from the Guggenheim , near Central Park . It is really very interesting.Also , there is a great museum of medieval European art further up north.It ' s called the Cloisters .	neutral	3
5874	How can we get up there ?	neutral	2
5875	You can take a bus .	neutral	3
5876	But Larry says the neighborhoods in the north are dangerous .	neutral	4
5877	Finally we have a long holiday .	neutral	1
5878	Yes , what about us having a tour ?	neutral	3
5879	Good idea . Where shall we go ?	neutral	2
5880	How about Milan ?	neutral	3
5881	Great . Shall we go alone or as part of the group ?	neutral	2
5882	Why not travel by ourselves ?	neutral	3
5883	Hello . This is John ’ s Distribution . Can I help you ?	neutral	2
5884	Yes . I need some ice water delivered .	neutral	1

5888	Thank you .	happiness	4
5889	No problem .	happiness	1
5890	Please come in and sit down . I'm happy to finally meet you .	neutral	3
5891	Same here . I've been looking forward to this .	neutral	1
5892	I ’ m sorry I kept you waiting so long . I'm running a little late today .	neutral	1
5893	No problem . That happens to all of us , it goes badly with the traffic .	neutral	1
5894	Thank you . Can I offer you some refreshment ?	neutral	3
5895	Why not , thank you . A little tea would be nice .	happiness	4
5896	I'm here to conduct the annual census of foreigners living in Beijing . This is my service ID card .	neutral	3
5897	OK . What do you want to know ?	neutral	2
5898	We only need to verify your information against our records .	neutral	3

5911	Why do you wash here ?	neutral	2
5912	It's actually a lot cheaper for me to wash my clothes here .	neutral	1
5913	I've only washed my clothes here a couple times .	neutral	1
5914	Why don't you wash clothes at home ?	neutral	2
5915	I would , if my washing machine wasn't broken .	neutral	1
5916	Why don't you just get it fixed ?	neutral	2
5917	I can't afford it .	neutral	1
5918	So you plan on washing your clothes here from now on ?	neutral	2
5919	That's my only option right now .	neutral	1
5920	Don't worry . Besides , it's a lot cheaper to wash clothes this way .	neutral	1
5921	Francis , you have done an outstanding work in the past six months . In view of your achievement , I trust you ’ re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title .	happiness	3
5922	I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company .	happiness	4
5923	This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you .	happiness	3

5927	I was hoping you'd have something on sale today .	neutral	3
5928	We have nothing on sale today . But we're having a big sale next weekend .	neutral	4
5929	Is the sale going to include dresses ?	neutral	2
5930	Everything you can see will be on sale .	neutral	1
5931	I like the sound of that . I'll just come back next weekend .	happiness	1
5932	The savings will be worth the short wait . See you next weekend .	happiness	1
5933	Good afternoon , sir.What Can I do for you ?	neutral	2
5934	Well . I can't find my key now . I think I have lost it .	sadness	1
5935	Really ? Have you left it in your room ?	neutral	2
5936	I don't think so . I took it with me when I went out this morning .	neutral	1
5937	Well , in that case , you have to pay for it . Please fill out the form first .	neutral	3
5938	How are you today ?	neutral	2
5939	Very well .	neutral	1
5940	Do you need help with something ?	neutral	2
5941	I need to make a transfer .	neutral	3

5950	Do you like the room ?	neutral	2
5951	Yes . What is the rent ?	neutral	2

5970	All right , miss.This one is very hot . I'll come to turn it off in fifteen minutes.Will that be alright ?	neutral	2
5971	OK .	neutral	1
5972	Come on . Don ’ t cheat on me . It ’ s a long shot .	surprise	3
5973	It ’ s true . You should be happy about that .	neutral	4
5974	I can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month .	neutral	1
5975	It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax .	neutral	1
5976	Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves .	neutral	1
5977	Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible .	neutral	2
5978	Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .	neutral	3
5979	What should I do to prepare for a job interview ?	neutral	2
5980	An understanding of the basic workings of a company and the services or goods it provides is essential . Do you have that ?	neutral	2
5981	Sort of , but I could know more , I guess .	neutral	1
5982	With that understanding , you can figure out what your company is looking for in terms of basic attitude . Right ?	neutral	3
5983	I think that they are a very formal company .	neutral	4
5984	What you wear is important . So keep in mind what is suitable for the company and type of work you will be doing . Need help ?	neutral	3
5985	I need a lot of help in this area .	neutral	4
5986	In addition to clothes we need to think about other basics , OK ?	neutral	3
5987	Yes , what else should we think of ?	neutral	2
5988	Be prompt . Don't forget to be friendly and interested . Listen carefully and listen to what they are really asking you . You'll be a hit !	happiness	3

5995	Do you have your passport with you ?	neutral	2
5996	Yes , here you go . I don't need a visa to go to Spain , do I ?	neutral	2
5997	Fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport .	neutral	1
5998	That's good advice .	neutral	1
5999	Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?	neutral	2
6000	Are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?	neutral	2
6001	Let me see here ... yes , there's one left .	neutral	1
6002	Ok . I'll take that one then .	neutral	3
6003	Alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?	neutral	2
6004	I like to travel light so I just have this one .	neutral	1
6005	If that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?	neutral	3
6006	Yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ?	neutral	2
6007	You're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight !	neutral	1
6008	All right . I want to bring everybody in on this project . When can we start working on this ?	neutral	2
6009	Well , we could probably get started with a strategy meeting tomorrow morning at 8	neutral	3
6010	I tell you what , 800 is no good for me , but why don ’ t you guys get started and I ’ ll come by at around 8	neutral	3
6011	That ’ s fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?	neutral	2
6012	I need a pan .	neutral	3
6013	Okay . Do you have a particular size in mind ?	neutral	2
6014	Well , the bigger the better , I think .	neutral	1
6015	Look at this one . It's our biggest pan .	neutral	3
6016	Yes , that is big enough , but it's too heavy for me .	neutral	4
6017	Okay , we have the same thing in aluminum .	neutral	3
6018	Oh , this is nice and light . But it has an aluminum handle .	neutral	4
6019	Try this one . Same aluminum pan , but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle .	neutral	3
6020	Oh , yes . This is very nice . I'll take this one .	happiness	4
6021	That's a good choice . How do you want to pay for it ?	happiness	2
6022	Cash . Oh , I almost forgot . I need a lid , too .	neutral	1
6023	I'm so sorry . A lid comes with the pan . Here it is .	neutral	1
6024	Well , Mr . Smith . That ’ s a nasty infection you have .	neutral	1
6025	Yes . Is there anything you can give me to get rid of it , Doctor ?	neutral	2
6026	I ’ m going to prescribe some antibiotics , and some cream to ease the itching and burning .	neutral	3
6027	OK . Thank you . Where should I buy them ?	neutral	2
6028	The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic .	neutral	3
6029	Great . What floor is the pharmacy on ?	neutral	2
6030	The fourth . I ’ ll send the prescription down there , so you can just pick it up on your way out .	neutral	3
6031	Thank you .	neutral	4
6032	Our factory locates at a village in the east of the city . The area of it is 3,600 square meters .	neutral	1
6033	We'd like to visit the factory . Can you show me the way ?	neutral	3
6034	That's OK ! We'll take you to have a tour . Please follow me .	neutral	4
6035	How many shifts are there in your factory ?	neutral	2

6041	It sounds nice . We can't wait to visiting the factory .	happiness	1

6043	Open your mouth , please . Which one ?	neutral	2
6044	The one right at the back .	neutral	1
6045	I'm afraid we can ’ t save that one . It will have to come out .	neutral	1
6046	Will it hurt much ?	neutral	2
6047	I'll give you an injection , then you won't feel pain .	neutral	3
6048	( 5 minutes later ) OK , it's all over . Spit there and bite the cotton ball tightly in place for half an hour .	neutral	3
6049	It's raining heavily .	neutral	1
6050	We have to find a shelter .	neutral	3
6051	All right .	neutral	4
6052	Let's go under the tree .	neutral	3
6053	No , we can't . It's thundering .	neutral	4
6054	Then let's go to that store .	neutral	3

6102	What are you having for lunch ?	neutral	2
6103	I got a sandwich , some chips , and a soda .	neutral	1
6104	Did you bring that from home ?	neutral	2
6105	I got it from the cafeteria .	neutral	1
6106	What kind of sandwich did you get ?	neutral	2
6107	They messed up my order and gave me a bologna sandwich .	neutral	1
6108	How was it ?	neutral	2
6109	Considering it wasn't what I ordered , it was still pretty good .	neutral	1
6110	I think I got a sandwich there once before .	neutral	1
6111	Really ?	surprise	2
6112	Yes , and they didn't get my order right either .	neutral	1
6113	Could you project what you would like to be doing five years from now ?	neutral	2
6114	As I have some administrative experience from my last job , I may use my organizational and planning skills in the future .	neutral	1
6115	How do you plan to accomplish this ?	neutral	2
6116	By doing everything necessary and for further study .	neutral	1
6117	How long would you like to stay with this company ?	neutral	2
6118	How long I will stay with the company depends on whether the company and I are satisfied with each other .	neutral	1
6119	What do you think of this industry's outlook in five years ?	neutral	2
6120	I do believe this industry will be developed rapidly in 5 years time .	neutral	1

6130	Hey , Jim , you're 15 minutes late . What's up ?	neutral	2
6131	I got stuck in a traffic jam .	neutral	1
6132	Hurry up , the show is about to start .	neutral	3
6133	It looks like you're very interested in the circus .	neutral	4
6134	Yes , I love to see the animal show .	neutral	1
6135	I have never seen those before , but since you're so excited it should be good .	neutral	1
6136	I'm sure you'll love it .	neutral	1
6137	Okay , I will go and get some popcorn first .	neutral	1
6138	May I have a cookie ?	neutral	3
6139	Help yourself .	neutral	4

6142	Can I have your keys , please ? Thank you . Here's your statement .	neutral	3
6143	Excuse me . What are these charges ?	neutral	2
6144	Oh , these are the phone charges and these are for something from the bar .	neutral	1
6145	Wait a minute . I made a phone call , but I never made a connection .	neutral	1
6146	I know , sir . Those aren't telephone company charges . Those are hotel charges .	neutral	1
6147	Isn't that a bit excessive ?	anger	3
6148	I'm sorry , sir . It's our policy .	neutral	4
6149	OK . Here is the money .	neutral	3
6150	Thank you . Welcome to our hotel again .	neutral	4
6151	Can I help you , sir ?	neutral	2
6152	Yes , I'd like to look at some suits .	neutral	3
6153	Oh , this way please . What size do you wear ?	neutral	2
6154	Size 41 . I want something in dark flannel .	neutral	1
6155	How about this one ?	neutral	3
6156	It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I'd like it better . This seems too light for winter . Do you think you could get me one ?	neutral	3
6157	All right . I'll show you something darker . Do you like this one ?	neutral	3
6158	It looks good . But can I try it on ?	neutral	3

6163	Mike , you're seventeen years old , right ?	neutral	2
6164	Yeah , Why ?	neutral	2
6165	You look quite mature beside your cousin who is eighteen .	neutral	1
6166	You can bet on that .	neutral	1
6167	Come in and sit down .	neutral	3
6168	Thanks , Mr . Liang .	neutral	4
6169	Among all the assistants , I think you're on top of it . Based on the annual evaluation , the board of directors decided to give you a bonus .	neutral	3
6170	Really ? I am too happy .	happiness	4
6171	I've been reviewing your work over the past few months . Thanks to your excellent work , we benefit much from your project . And you should get the perfect attendance award too .	neutral	3
6172	Thanks for your trust . Owing to my colleagues ' help , I've successfully completed my task .	happiness	1
6173	You are very modest and diligent . The distribution of bonus derived from the performance evaluation . You deserve it .	neutral	1
6174	Thank you very much . I will redouble my efforts in the future .	happiness	1
6175	Donna ! How are you ? It's good to hear your voice .	neutral	2
6176	Thank you . Jack , it's always a pleasure doing business with you .	neutral	1
6177	So how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave ?	neutral	2
6178	Great ! And , how are things in your neck of the woods ?	neutral	1
6179	Things are so great here . I almost smiled myself to death last week . One of my coworkers had to give me CPR .	happiness	1
6180	Oh.Jack , I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha ! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It ' s your gift .	happiness	1
6181	Or a curse .	neutral	1
6182	Nope , it's a gift.Anyway , we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time .	neutral	3
6183	That , my dear , was classic sales technique delivered by a professional .	neutral	4
6184	Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ?	neutral	2
6185	Heck no , we doubled the price , but because it's you , I'll let you have'em at 50 off .	neutral	3
6186	You silver-tongued devil . Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ?	neutral	3
6187	I could , but where's the fun in that ?	neutral	2
6188	Hi . I ’ m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay.How long of a delay is expected ?	neutral	2
6189	So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case .	neutral	3
6190	Do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ?	neutral	2
6191	I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ?	neutral	3
6192	What seems to be the problem ?	neutral	2
6193	It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry .	neutral	1
6194	Umm ... You know ... Actually I was thinking of trying another airline . No need to hold my seat .	neutral	3
6195	I need to go to the ATM .	neutral	3
6196	So , why don ’ t you ?	neutral	2
6197	I have no idea how to use the ATM .	neutral	3
6198	What do you mean ?	neutral	2
6199	This will be my first time using an ATM .	neutral	1
6200	I can help you with that .	neutral	3
6201	Explain to me how to use it .	neutral	3
6202	Just put your card into the machine .	neutral	3
6203	Now what do I do ?	neutral	2
6204	Then you need to type in your PIN .	neutral	3
6205	Now what ?	neutral	2
6206	Just click on one of the choices they give you , and that ’ s it .	neutral	3
6207	Would you like something to drink ?	neutral	2
6208	Yes please . Do you have any teas ?	neutral	2
6209	Of course we have lots of teas ?	neutral	2
6210	What do you recommend ?	neutral	2
6211	What about a green tea or perhaps a jasmine tea ?	neutral	3
6212	What ’ s this one ?	neutral	2
6213	That ’ s Oolong tea – it ’ s a Cantonese tea .	neutral	1
6214	Ok , I ’ ll try that .	neutral	4
6215	May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ?	neutral	2
6216	Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing !	surprise	1
6217	Why are they all in glass boxes ?	neutral	2
6218	For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .	neutral	1
6219	So there isn't air in the glass boxes ?	neutral	2
6220	No , there isn't . They are all vacuumed .	neutral	1
6221	I wonder how old these things are , thousands of years ?	neutral	2
6222	Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time .	neutral	1
6223	Hey , look at the three-leg cup . I've seen it on TV .	neutral	3
6224	The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless !	surprise	1
6225	Yeah , it has no value at all . Who will use this cup today ?	neutral	1
6226	Danny , priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it .	neutral	1
6227	Oh , it does ?	neutral	2
6228	I am so worried about this English contest . I have butterflies in my stomach now !	fear	1
6229	I have confidence in you . Believe in yourself .	neutral	1
6230	What would you like on your pizzas ?	neutral	2
6231	We want one vegetarian supreme and one double pepperoni .	neutral	1
6232	Would you like anything to drink with that ? For $ 1.50 , you can get a two-liter bottle of Coke .	neutral	2
6233	No , thanks .	neutral	1
6234	All right . That'll be $ 12.50 . Your pizzas will be there in 30 minutes .	neutral	3
6235	Thanks .	happiness	4
6236	We are redecorating and I'm going to add some things .	neutral	3
6237	Well , I'll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office .	neutral	3
6238	Shall we meet at 1:15 this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .	neutral	3
6239	Fine , I'll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday .	neutral	4
6240	Can you tell me the way to library ?	neutral	3
6241	Sure , turn left at the next crossing .	neutral	4
6242	Is it on Xinhua street ?	neutral	2
6243	Yes . You can't miss it .	neutral	1
6244	Comfort Inn , may I help you ?	neutral	2
6245	I ’ m looking for a hotel near the convention center .	neutral	3
6246	You ’ re in luck ! We ’ re just a two-minute drive from there . Would you like to make a reservation ?	neutral	3
6247	Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ?	neutral	2
6248	During the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . But we ’ Ve got a Single Super Saver Special going on right now – only $ 30 a night . And we ’ Ve also extended our checkout time 00 in	neutral	1
6249	That ’ s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients .	neutral	3
6250	Yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . We can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . Of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking	neutral	4
6251	That sounds great . Do you accept checks ?	neutral	2
6252	I ’ m sorry , sir , we don ’ t . But we do accept all major credit cards .	neutral	3
6253	I am sorry to trouble you , but there's a lot of noise in the next room .	neutral	3
6254	Oh , is there ? Which room is it ?	neutral	2
6255	It's . I think , neighbours on the right .	neutral	1
6256	You mean the room thirteen-thirteen ?	neutral	2
6257	I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhausted , but I can't sleep .	neutral	1
6258	All right , ma'am . I'll check and tell them to be quiet .	neutral	3
6259	If next room is still noisy , could you give me a different room , please ?	neutral	3
6260	Have you ever been to Xi ’ an ?	neutral	2
6261	Yes , I ’ Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city .	neutral	1
6262	I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place .	neutral	1
6263	I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening .	neutral	1
6264	Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ?	neutral	2
6265	Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train .	neutral	1
6266	A ticket to London , please .	neutral	3
6267	A cheap day return ticket ?	neutral	2
6268	Yes , including London Tube .	neutral	1
6269	That'll be twelve pounds .	neutral	4
6270	Doctor , what is the best way to stay healthy ?	neutral	2
6271	Having a good diet is probably the most important thing .	neutral	1
6272	It is very confusing to know what to eat .	neutral	1
6273	You need plenty of fruits and vegetables , small amounts of protein , and whole grains .	neutral	3
6274	Are there certain things that I should avoid ?	neutral	2
6275	You shouldn ’ t consume too much sugar or caffeine . Also , watch your intake of fatty food .	neutral	3
6276	After watching my diet , what else should I do ?	neutral	2
6277	You need to stop smoking , and make sure that you get 30 minutes of exercise every day .	neutral	3
6278	Can I have a glass of wine now and then ?	neutral	3
6279	As long as you don ’ t overdo it , a glass of wine a day should be OK .	neutral	4
6280	Darling , I am back . What are you doing ?	neutral	2
6281	I am washing clothes . Are you hungry now ? Wait for a moment , I'll cook dinner for you . ( Steven bends his brows )	neutral	3
6282	B , should we get a maid ?	neutral	2
6283	I can do all the housework . We don't need a maid .	neutral	1
6284	You have worked very hard in the office . If we can get someone to help you , you can have more rest .	neutral	1
6285	We really don't need to .	neutral	1
6286	You are a good wife , Julia . But you must take care of yourself .	neutral	3
6287	Give me some time to think about it .	neutral	4
6288	Can I reserve a room from the 13th to the 18th ?	neutral	3
6289	Certainly . How do you like your room ?	neutral	2
6290	I'd like a suite . What's the rate ?	neutral	2
6291	$ 40 per night .	neutral	1
6292	Is there anything I can do for you ?	neutral	2
6293	Excuse me , can I change my order ? I am afraid I don't have so much time to enjoy my dinner .	neutral	3
6294	I am sorry , sir . Your fish will be ready in five minutes so you can't change it .	sadness	4
6295	That's all right .	neutral	1
6296	Have you graduated now ?	neutral	2
6297	Yes . I graduated this past June .	neutral	1
6298	Which university did you graduate from ?	neutral	2
6299	Guangzhou University .	neutral	1
6300	What degree did you receive ?	neutral	2
6301	I received a bachelor's degree in Economics .	neutral	1
6302	What courses did you take in college ?	neutral	2
6303	My major courses were Microeconomics , Macroeconomics , International Trade , International Finance , World Economy , Psychology and Business English	neutral	1
6304	Why did you choose to study Economics ?	neutral	2
6305	Because I was quite interested in Economics then .	neutral	1
6306	Can you speak other languages except English ?	neutral	2
6307	I can also speak a little Japanese .	neutral	1
6308	I am very satisfied with your answers .	happiness	1
6309	Thank you very much .	happiness	1
6310	Once you arrive at the American airport , please call me .	neutral	3
6311	OK , don ’ t worry about it . I will .	neutral	4
6312	Take care of yourself .	neutral	1
6313	Sorry , Mary , I can't make it in time for dinner .	neutral	1
6314	Okay , Bob , when will I see you ?	neutral	2
6315	Maybe I will be around later .	neutral	3
6316	Okay , I'll see you later .	neutral	4
6317	I am sorry , sir . I have broken the reading lamp in my room .	sadness	1
6318	Well , sir . May I have your room number ?	neutral	3
6319	503 . I would like to pay for it .	neutral	4
6320	Please fill out the form first .	neutral	3
6321	OK , can you bring me a new one ?	neutral	3
6322	Of course .	neutral	4
6323	Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription .	neutral	3
6324	It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .	neutral	1
6325	Yes , I need to refill it today .	neutral	3
6326	Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice .	neutral	4
6327	I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not .	neutral	1
6328	Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .	neutral	3
6329	Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ?	neutral	3
6330	I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out .	neutral	4
6331	But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription .	neutral	3
6332	Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never .	neutral	4
6333	But I have a prescription . I just need more of it .	neutral	3
6334	A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .	neutral	4
6335	Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .	neutral	3
6336	Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry .	neutral	4
6337	This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it .	anger	1
6338	Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too .	neutral	1
6339	What are you doing ?	neutral	2
6340	I ’ m trying to put the vase on the shelf .	neutral	1
6341	Let regive you a hand .	neutral	3
6342	No , thank you . I can manage it , I think .	neutral	4
6343	There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose .	neutral	1
6344	Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .	neutral	3
6345	I'd rather get one with separated speakers.They give a clear sound .	neutral	4
6346	Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .	neutral	1
6347	That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .	neutral	2
6348	Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration .	neutral	3
6349	Ahhchooo !	neutral	1
6350	You've been sneezing a lot lately . Are you sick or something ?	neutral	2
6351	No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies .	neutral	1
6352	I never have seasonal allergies .	neutral	1
6353	Consider yourself lucky .	neutral	1
6354	What are all the symptoms ?	neutral	2
6355	Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water .	neutral	1
6356	That doesn't sound good .	neutral	1
6357	No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ?	neutral	2
6358	Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family .	neutral	1
6359	Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol .	neutral	1
6360	I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body .	neutral	1
6361	That's pretty bad .	neutral	1
6362	But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah .	happiness	1
6363	Let's have a look at the map first .	neutral	3
6364	All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here .	neutral	4
6365	Let's buy some tickets .	neutral	3
6366	The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train	neutral	4
6367	Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?	neutral	2
6368	No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them .	neutral	1
6369	What do you do ?	neutral	2
6370	I'm an apprentice with a local engineering firm . My training lasts for two years . Two days a week I study Engineering at a local college . If I pass all my exams , I hope the company will take me on as an engineer .	neutral	1
6371	I want to keep a pet , but I don't know which one to buy ?	neutral	1
6372	Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day .	neutral	1
6373	Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then .	neutral	1
6374	What about cats ? They are more independent .	neutral	3
6375	Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat .	neutral	4
6376	How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ?	neutral	3
6377	Yeah , are they easy to look after ?	neutral	2
6378	Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything .	neutral	1
6379	Can I be of any service to you ?	neutral	2
6380	I've been told that Chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . We'd like to take some home . What would you recommend ?	neutral	3
6381	There are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop.For example , there is tricolored pottery originating in the Tang Dynasty , embroidery , batik , jade carving , just to name a few.Do you have anything in mind ?	neutral	2
6382	No , not really.But I think it should be something distinctively Chinese . And easy to carry .	neutral	1
6383	I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik.They are very easy to carry .	neutral	3
6384	So , we'd like to see some embroidery .	neutral	4
6385	Hey , Mary . We're back . Have you eaten yet ?	neutral	2
6386	I had some bread for breakfast .	neutral	1
6387	Let's go out for brunch .	neutral	3
6388	Brunch ?	neutral	2
6389	It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also .	neutral	1
6390	Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch .	neutral	4
6391	Hi , my name is Sovia.What ’ s your name ?	neutral	2
6392	My name is Jeff .	neutral	1

6440	Did you go to a real estate agent ?	neutral	2
6441	No , that will be too expensive .	neutral	1
6442	That's true . By the way , what kind of apartment are you looking for ?	neutral	2
6443	My first job's salary will be a bit low . So the cheaper the better . Just one I can afford .	neutral	1
6444	Sure . I'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you .	happiness	1

6491	Of course , you have . You must try harder this time .	neutral	1
6492	And must I go back to school ?	neutral	2
6493	No , you needn ’ t do that . You ’ d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes .	neutral	1
6494	But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ’ m nearly 17 .	neutral	1
6495	You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study .	neutral	3

6531	Well , the 4 x 6 is fine .	neutral	1

6552	I thought this was the emergency room .	neutral	2
6553	It is . But unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait.You aren't bleeding , are you ?	neutral	2
6554	No . Only a little . I fell off my porch .	neutral	1
6555	Oh , that's terrible . Is it your right arm or your left arm ?	neutral	2
6556	My left arm .	neutral	1

6575	Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet .	happiness	1

6578	That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ?	happiness	2
6579	No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .	neutral	1
6580	So , what programs do you have on your laptop ?	neutral	2
6581	I ’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs .	neutral	1
6582	I know you are keen on photography . It ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at a	neutral	1

6605	I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ?	neutral	3
6606	Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful .	neutral	1
6607	How do you think if I volunteer for some work ?	neutral	2
6608	I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives .	neutral	1

6625	I couldn't find the files you request , even though I checked all the cross-references . I don't think it's there .	neutral	1
6626	I am sure that document was filed .	neutral	1
6627	Well , let me check again under a different heading .	neutral	3
6628	Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files .	neutral	4
6629	Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' .	neutral	1
6630	What would you have ?	neutral	2
6631	I'll try Chinese wine .	neutral	1
6632	What about this dry red ? It's good indeed , it never goes to the head .	neutral	3
6633	OK . Give me one , please .	happiness	4

6641	My polling place is at the park up the street .	neutral	1
6642	Oh , yeah ?	neutral	2
6643	Yeah , where is yours ?	neutral	2
6644	I don ’ t know .	neutral	1
6645	How is it you don ’ t know ?	surprise	2
6646	The location of my polling place never came in the mail .	neutral	1
6647	You can always just check online .	neutral	1
6648	Let me go do that .	neutral	1
6649	I am sorry , I have broken my wine glass , and would you please bring me another ?	neutral	3
6650	Sure . I will clean the glasses for you .	neutral	4

6653	What's wrong , officer ?	neutral	2
6654	You do realize that you ran a red light , don't you ?	neutral	2
6655	I did ?	surprise	2
6656	You didn't see the red light ?	neutral	2
6657	I'm sorry for running it , but I really didn't know .	sadness	1
6658	Didn't you learn that red means stop ?	neutral	2
6659	I know that .	neutral	1
6660	Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light .	neutral	3
6661	I'm not sure .	neutral	4
6662	I'm giving you a ticket for this .	neutral	3
6663	I'm sorry for the misunderstanding .	sadness	4
6664	Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light .	neutral	1
6665	Medicine Industry , this is Peter Bush speaking , can I help you ?	neutral	3
6666	Good afternoon , could you connect this call with Mr Brown , please	neutral	3

6669	I'm sorry , Mrs Li , Mr Brown is now in a meeting.May I have your number , and ask him to call you back later ?	neutral	3

6683	Just things we need for the picnic tomorrow .	neutral	1
6684	Well , hurry up and open the door please . I told you these things are heavy .	neutral	3
6685	I'm sorry , but I just can't find the key . You must have it .	sadness	4
6686	Oh , yes , it's in my pocket . But how can I get the key while I'm holding all these bags ?	neutral	2

6692	It's getting late , and you have to wake up early tomorrow .	neutral	3
6693	There is no way that I can fall asleep right now .	neutral	4
6694	Try listening to some soft music .	neutral	3
6695	It won't work . I'm nowhere close to being tired .	neutral	4
6696	I really don't care , just go to sleep .	neutral	3
6697	What if I stay up and do something , until I get tired ?	neutral	2

6706	What do you think ?	neutral	3
6707	I love that shirt on you .	neutral	4
6708	What about the jeans ?	neutral	3
6709	They don't really fit you right .	neutral	4
6710	I don't think so either .	neutral	1
6711	That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though .	neutral	1
6712	Well , I'll just buy the shirt .	neutral	1
6713	That would be a good idea .	happiness	1
6714	Now , Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I ’ Ve had the chance to look it over and I must say I ’ m quite impressed .	neutral	3
6715	Thank you very much . I ’ Ve tried to keep it short and clear . If there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me .	neutral	4
6716	Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .	neutral	3
6717	Yes , of course . Well as you can see from the resume I ’ m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around sixteen .	neutral	1
6718	Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ?	neutral	2
6719	Yes precisely . Although I was born in the US , I would definitely call London home . But as you see I ’ Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . My Father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too .	neutral	1
6720	Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .	neutral	1
6721	Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ’ m really looking to settle down .	neutral	1
6722	I see . okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ?	neutral	3
6723	Can you tell me , Ms . Smith , about the training programs you initiated this year ?	neutral	3
6724	We ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained .	neutral	1
6725	What ’ s the result ?	neutral	2
6726	We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received .	neutral	1
6727	That seems very impressive . Good work !	happiness	1
6728	Thank you , but I cannot take all the credit . Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level .	happiness	1
6729	Well , good morning , Tom . I haven't seen you for a long time .	neutral	1
6730	I'd been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago .	sadness	1
6731	What seems to be the trouble now ?	neutral	2
6732	I feel run down , tired . I've been having headaches almost every day . And I'm not getting as much sleep as usually do .	neutral	1
6733	Have you been eating properly ? Eating the right kind of food is important for your health , you know .	neutral	2
6734	Well , I haven't been eating well , I guess . I usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch .	sadness	1
6735	And what about dinner ?	neutral	2
6736	Sometimes I'm too tired to eat anything at all .	neutral	1
6737	That's not good . You don't have a well-balanced diet . Have you been taking vitamin pills ?	neutral	3
6738	I don't like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first .	neutral	4
6739	Thank you for purchasing your new mattress with us .	happiness	1
6740	No , thank you .	happiness	1
6741	Would you like us to deliver the mattress for you , sir ?	neutral	3
6742	That would be great .	happiness	4
6743	When do you want it delivered ?	neutral	2
6744	I need it delivered tomorrow . Will that be possible ?	neutral	2
6745	What time exactly ?	neutral	2
6746	I need it delivered at 12 o'clock .	neutral	1
6747	We can have it to you at that time .	neutral	1
6748	That's not a problem ?	neutral	2
6749	We will deliver your mattress tomorrow at 12 o'clock .	neutral	1
6750	That's great ! Thank you very much .	happiness	1
6751	Can I help you ?	neutral	2
6752	Yes , I'm looking for a house .	neutral	3
6753	To buy or to rent ?	neutral	2
6754	Oh , to rent .	neutral	1
6755	How much do you want to pay ?	neutral	2
6756	About 300 a month .	neutral	1
6757	Well , I've got one here . It's 260 a month .	neutral	4
6758	How big is it ?	neutral	2
6759	It's got a kitchen , a bathroom , and one bedroom .	neutral	1
6760	Well , actually I prefer something a bit bigger if that's possible .	neutral	1
6761	Yes , I think so . There is also an interesting one.It ' s opposite the park .	neutral	3
6762	How much is it ?	neutral	2
6763	It's 325 a month . It's the biggest we've got in this area .	neutral	1
6764	What's it like ?	neutral	2
6765	Well , There're two bedrooms , a sitting room , a kitchen and a bathroom .	neutral	1
6766	It sounds interesting . Can I go and see it ?	happiness	3
6767	Of course , Sir .	neutral	4
6768	Would you please mail these letters , Lucy ?	neutral	3
6769	Yes , Sir .	neutral	4
6770	These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . Others are ordinary letters .	neutral	3
6771	All right , who should I send them to ?	neutral	2
6772	It ’ s sent to Mr . Charles . I believe he is in London .	neutral	1
6773	Ok , home or office address ?	neutral	2
6774	Office address , please . He might be at work when they arrive .	neutral	3
6775	Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?	neutral	3
6776	Yes , it ’ s right .	neutral	4
6777	What are you reading ?	neutral	2
6778	Oh , it ’ s the latest novel by Ray Blue . It ’ s a sic-fi thriller .	neutral	1
6779	I thought he usually wrote horror books .	surprise	1
6780	He does . He ’ s good at this genre too . It ’ s a captivating read .	neutral	1
6781	We ’ re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ?	neutral	3
6782	Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks .	neutral	4
6783	Me too . I need something to read on the flight to New York . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ’ s books for her daughter .	neutral	1
6784	I want to look at nelson Mandela ’ s autobiography .	neutral	1
6785	This is sure to be a worthwhile read .	neutral	1
6786	Doctor , I have the worst toothache !	sadness	1
6787	How long have you had this pain ?	neutral	2
6788	For about a week or so , but it ’ s gotten really bad in the last couple of days .	neutral	1
6789	Did you do anything that might have aggravated your tooth ?	neutral	2
6790	You know , I was eating jawbreakers in the movies the other day , and I accidentally bit down really hard on one .	neutral	1
6791	What kind of toothbrush do you use ?	neutral	2
6792	I just use a regular hard bristle toothbrush .	neutral	1
6793	Does it bother you when you eat something really cold ?	neutral	2
6794	Yes , it definitely bothers me more when I do that .	neutral	1
6795	Good evening .	neutral	1
6796	Good evening.My wife and I would like a room , please.Is there any room available ? We don't have a reservation .	neutral	3
6797	Let me see.Yes , we have one room left.You ' re lucky.It ' s the last one .	neutral	1
6798	Good.We ' re tired after driving all day , and we're looking forward to relaxing in a comfortable room .	neutral	3
6799	This room has two double beds.It ' s number 56 at the rear of the motel.It ' s quite a comfortable room .	neutral	4
6800	How much is it for one night ? We only need it for tonight.We ' re going to continue our trip in the morning .	neutral	2
6801	It's forty-five dollars a night for two.Is anyone else traveling with you ?	neutral	2
6802	No , it's just the two of us .	neutral	1
6803	Would you like to pay for the room in cash or with a credit card ?	neutral	2
6804	Credit card.We don't like to carry much cash with us on our trips .	neutral	1
6805	Please fill out this registration card.Here is your key.You can park your car in front of our room.Check - out time is noon .	neutral	3
6806	Thank you very much .	neutral	4
6807	Thank you , sir.Enjoy your stay with us .	neutral	1
6808	Let's go to the animal shelter .	neutral	3
6809	What do you want to do ?	neutral	2
6810	I want to get a puppy for my son .	neutral	1
6811	That will make him so happy .	neutral	1
6812	I'll get him one of those little dogs .	neutral	1
6813	One that won't grow up too big .	neutral	1
6814	And eat too much .	neutral	1
6815	Do you know which one he would like ?	neutral	2
6816	Oh , yes , I took him there yesterday . He showed me one that he really liked .	neutral	1
6817	I bet you had to drag him away .	neutral	1
6818	He wanted to take it home yesterday .	neutral	1
6819	I wonder what he'll name it .	neutral	1
6820	Hello . I want to send the computer to my sister in Shanghai by logistics transport .	neutral	3
6821	OK . Is it in the box ? May I see it ?	neutral	3
6822	Yes . This is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor .	neutral	4
6823	Is there anything else ?	neutral	2
6824	There are a mouse and a camera .	neutral	1
6825	Is that all ?	neutral	2
6826	Yes . How much is it to send these things to Shanghai by regular delivery ?	neutral	2
6827	It depends on the weight of these things . Generally speaking , we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram .	neutral	1
6828	I see . Can you weigh them for me , please ?	neutral	3
6829	Please go over there to weigh them .	neutral	4
6830	OK . See you later .	neutral	1
6831	what happened ? Why didn't he win ?	surprise	2
6832	didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .	neutral	1
6833	how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !	surprise	2
6834	if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .	neutral	1
6835	what ? What kind of drugs was he using ?	surprise	2
6836	he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .	neutral	1
6837	I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .	neutral	1
6838	they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .	neutral	1
6839	that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .	neutral	1
6840	I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !	neutral	1
6841	regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .	neutral	1
6842	I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .	neutral	1
6843	let's hope so .	neutral	1
6844	I need to use the ATM .	neutral	3
6845	What ’ s stopping you ?	neutral	2
6846	I ’ m not sure how .	neutral	1
6847	I don ’ t understand .	neutral	1
6848	I ’ Ve never used one before .	neutral	1
6849	I can help you figure it out .	neutral	3
6850	What do I have to do ?	neutral	2
6851	Slide your card into the machine .	neutral	3
6852	Then what ?	neutral	2
6853	You need to type your PIN in .	neutral	3
6854	What do I have to do next ?	neutral	2
6855	Click on whichever option you want , and you ’ re done .	neutral	3
6856	"What are you doing ? Checking the "" to do "" list for the wedding ?"	neutral	2
6857	Yep . There's still so much to do !	neutral	1
6858	So let's start by checking off what we've already done .	neutral	3
6859	Did you reconfirm the plane reservations for all the Taiwanese guests ?	neutral	2
6860	Not yet , I was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the Net .	neutral	1
6861	Cool ! I can't believe he agreed to go all the way to Dallas with us !	happiness	1
6862	Hey ! We're paying for his ticket !	neutral	1
6863	It is my first time coming to China . I want to buy something unique of China to my friends as gifts .	neutral	3
6864	We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ?	happiness	4
6865	Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them .	neutral	1
6866	You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ?	happiness	3
6867	Sounds good . May I have a look ?	happiness	3
6868	Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on .	happiness	4
6869	They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs .	neutral	3
6870	All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality .	happiness	4
6871	Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ?	neutral	2
6872	This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac .	neutral	1
6873	Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones .	neutral	3
6874	OK , I will wrap them for you .	happiness	4
6875	Can you make out what he's saying ?	neutral	2
6876	No , it's too loud in here .	neutral	1
6877	Excuse me .	neutral	1
6878	Yes ?	neutral	2
6879	Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram , please ?	neutral	3
6880	Certainly . Go along Queen's Road ...	happiness	3
6881	Along Queen's Road ...	neutral	4
6882	Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel .	neutral	3
6883	Right at the Hilton .	neutral	4
6884	Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral .	neutral	3
6885	The Cathedral ?	neutral	2
6886	Yes . Then cross the road at the next traffic lights . The Peak Tram is straight ahead . You can't miss it .	neutral	3
6887	That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ?	happiness	2
6888	Yes . Why ?	neutral	2
6889	Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down .	neutral	3
6890	Hi , Nally , are you hungry ?	neutral	2
6891	I'm starving . Let's go grab a bite .	neutral	3
6892	Where to ?	neutral	2
6893	How about Karlis ?	neutral	3
6894	Are you kidding ? That place is too ritzy for lunch .	surprise	4
6895	True . ok Let's go to Grumose ?	neutral	3
6896	Same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg .	neutral	4
6897	I guess it is a little pricy .	neutral	1
6898	Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch ..	neutral	3
6899	That will be Ok . Come on , I can't wait to chow down .	neutral	4
6900	That was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy .	neutral	1
6901	Is that why you stiffed the waiter ?	neutral	2
6902	You got it . All right , Let's go back to school .	neutral	3
6903	Good morning , sir .	neutral	1
6904	Good morning . I'd like a business suit made with this material .	neutral	3
6905	Do you have a particular style in mind ?	neutral	2
6906	The kind that never goes out of fashion , I guess .	neutral	1
6907	I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes .	neutral	3
6908	I'm sure you're right . I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year .	neutral	4
6909	The changes are usually not that dramatic . We just got some pictures of the latest fashion . Would you like to take a look ?	neutral	3
6910	Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ?	happiness	2
6911	Next Friday .	neutral	1
6912	Thank you .	happiness	1
6913	Oh , gosh ! I feel everything around me is against me .	sadness	1
6914	Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 .	neutral	3
6915	Well , I am all ears . Maybe they are helpful .	neutral	4
6916	Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age .	neutral	3
6917	I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it .	neutral	4
6918	Good luck to us .	neutral	1
6919	Look , Mary ! There are so many people over there !	neutral	3
6920	Oh , I remember , there is a job fair in the personnel market .	neutral	1
6921	I have never been to the personnel market .	neutral	1
6922	Really ? I have been there several times .	surprise	1
6923	Are there many employers ?	neutral	2
6924	Yes . The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers .	neutral	1
6925	So there will be many large companies in the personnel market , right ?	neutral	2
6926	Yes , there are many famous corporations .	neutral	1
6927	When will there be a job fair ?	neutral	2
6928	Every Saturday and Sunday	neutral	1
6929	Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market ?	neutral	2
6930	No , it's free .	neutral	1
6931	How about going there to have a look now ?	neutral	3
6932	OK , let's go .	neutral	4
6933	Could you show me the T-shirt on the model ?	neutral	3
6934	Here you are . We have three different colors , white , blue and pink .	neutral	4
6935	What's the price ?	neutral	2
6936	$ 12 .	neutral	1
6937	Can you make it any cheaper ?	neutral	3
6938	It is cheap .	neutral	4
6939	I'll take it if you give me a discount .	neutral	3
6940	$ 10 . That's the best I can do .	neutral	4
6941	OK . I'll take the blue one .	happiness	1
6942	Hello , again . Did you discuss everything with your colleagues ?	neutral	2
6943	Yes , yes . It seems that everything is settled .	neutral	1
6944	Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ?	neutral	2
6945	We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts , whether they are currently with this bank or not .	neutral	1
6946	That's not a problem .	neutral	1
6947	Of course , if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank , or open new accounts with you .	neutral	1
6948	Thank you very much . We always welcome new customers .	happiness	1
6949	I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .	neutral	1
6950	We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments .	neutral	3
6951	I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .	neutral	4
6952	We need to find a good realtor .	neutral	3
6953	Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .	neutral	4
6954	What do you mean ?	neutral	2
6955	Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .	neutral	1
6956	But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .	neutral	1
6957	Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .	neutral	1
6958	I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has	neutral	1
6959	Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .	neutral	1
6960	So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?	neutral	2
6961	It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .	neutral	1
6962	And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?	neutral	2
6963	Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .	neutral	1
6964	Why ?	surprise	2
6965	Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .	neutral	1
6966	Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .	neutral	1
6967	It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .	neutral	1
6968	I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .	neutral	3
6969	Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store .	neutral	4
6970	I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening.My wife is terribly ill .	neutral	1
6971	Sorry to hear that .	neutral	1
6972	How about next week ?	neutral	3
6973	Fine , we'll be expecting you then .	neutral	4
6974	Which restaurant do you prefer ?	neutral	2
6975	I'd like to taste Mexican food .	neutral	1
6976	How about the one on Baker Street ?	neutral	3
6977	Oh , I've never seen a better Mexican restaurant .	happiness	4
6978	The numbers in this table don't seem to be in accord with reality .	neutral	1
6979	I know , but these are the figures that we came up with .	neutral	1
6980	Oh , so the zoo is over there . Thank you so much for your help .	neutral	1
6981	You ’ re welcome . Can I ask you what brings you to China ?	neutral	2
6982	I ’ m actually travelling around Asia .	neutral	1
6983	Oh , very nice . How long will you be in Beijing ?	neutral	2
6984	Probably another week .	neutral	1
6985	Oh , I see . Well , I ’ ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide , please call me .	neutral	3
6986	Thank you very much . That ’ s very kind .	happiness	4
6987	Could you type up this document for me , Sandra ?	neutral	3
6988	Sure , but I have to finish this report first .	neutral	4
6989	Never mind . I'll do it .	neutral	3
6990	Are you interested in mountaineering ?	neutral	2
6991	Yes , in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you	neutral	2
6992	I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . I went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains .	neutral	1
6993	How did you spend the night there ?	neutral	2
6994	We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful .	neutral	1
6995	I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country .	neutral	1
6996	Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't ?	neutral	2
6997	Yes . It is one of the Five Mountains .	neutral	1
6998	I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ?	neutral	3
6999	I'd love to .	happiness	4
7000	Sir , what's wrong with you ?	neutral	2
7001	I have a spasm of nausea and dizziness .	neutral	1
7002	Have you ever suffered from airsickness before ? You're probably airsick .	neutral	2
7003	No , this is the first time on a plane . Maybe you are right .. Please get me some pills .	neutral	3
7004	OK . I will get some for you . There's an airsickness bag behind the seat in front of you.Please wait me for a moment . ( Go away for a few minutes , and now she comes back . ) Here are two pills . And the water is in the glass too.Please take the pills with water .	neutral	4
7005	Thank you very much . ( Take the pills . )	neutral	1
7006	Are you feeling better now ?	neutral	2
7007	Much better now . Thanks again .	happiness	1
7008	My pleasure .	happiness	1
7009	Hi Bill , it ’ s Jane .	neutral	1
7010	Jane , I ’ m on the other line , can you hang on for a second ?	neutral	3
7011	Sure .	neutral	4
7012	OK , I ’ ll be right back .	neutral	1
7013	Have you decided what you'd like ?	neutral	2
7014	Yes . First I'll have tomato juice .	neutral	3
7015	And then ?	neutral	2
7016	I'll have the lamb chops , well-done , please .	neutral	3
7017	Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ?	neutral	2
7018	Can you show me some traditional Chinese arts and crafts ?	neutral	3
7019	Maybe sandalwood fan is good .	neutral	4
7020	Would you show me some ?	neutral	3
7021	Of course .	neutral	4
7022	They really smell fragrant . How much is a real sandalwood fan ?	neutral	2
7023	The small ones are one hundred yuan for each . And the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan .	neutral	1
7024	I'll take two small ones and a big one .	neutral	3
7025	What else are you interested in ?	neutral	2
7026	I'm afraid not .	neutral	1
7027	OK . Here you are .	happiness	4
7028	Good morning.Mrs.Smith .	neutral	1
7029	Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother .	neutral	3
7030	Well , what kind of books does she like ?	neutral	2

7041	Not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements .	neutral	1
7042	Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air .	neutral	3
7043	I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world !	neutral	4
7044	Really ? What's the series about ?	neutral	2
7045	Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it .	neutral	1
7046	It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth .	neutral	1
7047	I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results .	neutral	1
7048	Really ? that's interesting !	happiness	1

7076	Any cigarettes or liquor ?	neutral	2
7077	I have cigarettes for my own use .	neutral	1
7078	I think you'll have to pay some duty on these cigarettes because they exceed the quota . And this article is liable for duty .	neutral	3
7079	How much duty should I pay ?	neutral	2
7080	One hundred dollars .	neutral	1
7081	Here is the money .	neutral	1
7082	Just a moment . I'll make out your duty memo . ( Writing and giving the memo to Mr . Green ) Take it and pay the girl over there .	neutral	3
7083	Thank you .	neutral	4
7084	So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ...	neutral	3
7085	We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ...	neutral	3
7086	That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket .	neutral	1
7087	Excuse me , sir , may I talk to you ?	neutral	3
7088	Bill ! Sure , come on in . What can I do for you ?	neutral	4
7089	Well sir , as you know , I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years .	neutral	1
7090	Yes .	neutral	1
7091	I won ’ t beat around the bush . Sir , I would like a raise . I currently have three companies after me and so I decided to talk to you first .	neutral	3
7092	A raise ? Son , I would love to give you a raise , but this is just not the right time .	neutral	4
7093	I understand your position , and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales , but you must also take into consideration my hard work , pro-activeness and loyalty to this company for over a decade .	neutral	3
7094	Taking into account these factors , and considering I don ’ t want to start a brain drain , I ’ m willing to offer you a ten percent raise and an extra five days of vacation time . How does that sound ?	neutral	3
7095	Great ! It ’ s a deal ! Thank you , sir !	neutral	4
7096	Before you go , just out of curiosity , what companies were after you ?	neutral	2
7097	Oh , the electric company , gas company and water company !	neutral	1

7128	He was actually quite handsome . What a shame .	neutral	1
7129	What's he going to do now ?	neutral	2

7654	Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order .	neutral	1
7655	Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot .	neutral	1
7656	So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting !	happiness	1
7657	Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility .	neutral	1
7658	Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car .	neutral	1
7659	I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us .	neutral	1
7660	Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ?	neutral	2
7661	Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives .	neutral	1
7662	I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice .	neutral	3
7663	Can I help you ?	neutral	2
7664	I'd like to send a fax to Shenzhen .	neutral	1
7665	Is it a photograph or a document ?	neutral	2
7666	Each of both .	neutral	1
7667	Could I see both of them ?	neutral	3
7668	Here you are .	neutral	4
7669	You can't send this document ; it is not clear enough to send . The photograph is all right .	neutral	1
7670	Well , how long will it take to arrive in Shenzhen ?	neutral	2
7671	Couple of minutes .	neutral	1
7672	Great . How much ?	neutral	2
7673	5 $ . You should change another much clearer photograph for fax .	neutral	1
7674	Thank you . I will deal with it .	happiness	1
7675	Good morning , can I see your passport , please ?	neutral	3
7676	Here you are .	neutral	4
7677	For business or pleasure ?	neutral	2
7678	Business .	neutral	1
7679	Thank you . Have a pleasant stay .	neutral	1
7680	Take care , Peter . Don't run so fast . Are you tired ?	neutral	2
7681	Oh , yes . May I sit on the grass ?	neutral	3
7682	No , you mustn't sit on the grass . Don't you see the notes ?	neutral	2
7683	Yes , I can see it . But what's on it ?	neutral	2
7684	It says ' Keep off the grass ! '	neutral	1
7685	Well , there's a bench under the tree . We can sit there .	neutral	3
7686	Be careful . You can't smoke here .	neutral	3
7687	Why not ?	neutral	2
7688	Can't you see the notes there ? It says ' No smoking here ' .	neutral	2
7689	I'd like a double room .	neutral	3
7690	Do you have a reservation ?	neutral	2
7691	Yes , I called you last week from New York . My name is George Lee .	neutral	1
7692	Wait a second , PLS . Yes , Mr . Lee , we have a room reserved for you . How long do you plan to stay ?	neutral	2
7693	Probably two days . My wife will join me tomorrow . Then we will decide when to leave for Seattle .	neutral	3
7694	Would you sign the register , PLS ?	neutral	3
7695	By the way , does my room have a private bath ?	neutral	2
7696	Certainly , every room in this hotel has a private bath .	neutral	1
7697	Does my room have twin beds or a double ? I prefer a room with twin beds .	neutral	3
7698	Your room has twin beds , Mr.Lee . It also has a view . I am sure you will like it . This is your key . It's on the eighth floor room 801 . The elevator's over there .	neutral	4
7699	Thank you . One more thing , where is your restaurant ?	neutral	2
7700	The restaurant is on the second floor . We also have a cafeteria on the top floor . If you would like something to drink , you can either call room service or come down here . The bar is right behind the lobby .	neutral	1
7701	Thank you , you are very kind !	happiness	1
7702	You are welcome !	happiness	1
7703	I need to find a bus that'll take me to the Gold Line .	neutral	3
7704	Where do you live ?	neutral	2
7705	I live up in Altadena .	neutral	1
7706	The 264 will take you there .	neutral	4
7707	It goes all the way there ?	neutral	2
7708	I know for a fact that it goes to the station .	neutral	1
7709	What street would I catch it on ?	neutral	2
7710	If you go to Altadena Drive , you can catch it there .	neutral	1
7711	I didn't know that bus went to the Gold Line station .	neutral	2
7712	Yup , it does .	neutral	1
7713	Well , thanks for letting me know .	happiness	1
7714	It was my pleasure .	happiness	1
7715	May I help you ?	neutral	2
7716	I have a problem .	neutral	1
7717	What ’ s the problem ?	neutral	2
7718	Someone else is making charges on my debit card .	neutral	1
7719	I need to see a statement for your debit card .	neutral	3
7720	I have it right here .	neutral	4
7721	Can you show me which charges you ’ re referring to ?	neutral	3
7722	The last four charges .	neutral	1
7723	We will need to do an investigation on this .	neutral	3
7724	How long will that take ?	neutral	2
7725	We ’ ll have to freeze payment on those charges until the investigation is finished .	neutral	3
7726	I really appreciate your help .	happiness	4
7727	Do you think we can go driving right now ?	neutral	2
7728	Yeah , sure . Let's go .	neutral	3
7729	Buckle up .	neutral	4
7730	All right . Now what ?	neutral	2
7731	Now you put the key in the ignition and start the car .	neutral	3
7732	Which direction should I take ?	neutral	2
7733	Make a left on this next street .	neutral	1
7734	Tell me how far to go .	neutral	3
7735	Keep going until I tell you to stop .	neutral	4
7736	Okay , but let me know ahead of time .	neutral	3
7737	That's all for today , so park right there .	neutral	4
7738	That was great . Thanks for taking me driving .	happiness	1
7739	I'm after some chinese incense burner ? How's this one ?	neutral	2

7763	Oh , what's up ?	neutral	4
7764	I locked myself out . What do you suggest I do ?	neutral	2

7908	256MB .	neutral	1
7909	then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB .	neutral	1
